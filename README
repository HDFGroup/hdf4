               README for HDF 4.1r5 Version
               ----------------------------

Obtaining the latest version
----------------------------
 The most recent version of the distribution can be obtained from
 the NCSA ftp archive site at:

     ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF/HDF_Current/

Distribution Layout
-------------------
 There are five subdirectories in this directory:

   config -- contains machine dependent makefile fragments(mh-<os>). 

   hdf    -- contains the source code for the HDF 'base library', the 
             the multi_file annotation interface, the multi_file raster
             image interface, HDF command line utilities (hdp, the hdf 
             dumper is in mfhdf/), Pablo instrumentation support, 
             and a test suite. It also contains the software
             distributions for IJPEG(hdf/jpeg) and ZLIB(hdf/zlib) 
             which are required by the HDF library. 
             Please see the README in each directory for further info
             on each package. 

   mfhdf  -- contains the netCDF(mfhdf) part of the HDF/mfhdf distribution
             and HDF dumper utility (hdp).

   man    -- incomplete set of man page(s) for HDF.

   release_notes -- descriptions on new features and bug fixes in this
                    release. Files in this sub-directory can be used 
                    as supplemental documentation for HDF4.1. These files 
                    are also available on the NCSA ftp server, 
                    in /HDF/HDF/HDF_Current/release_notes/.

Third Party Software Requirements:
---------------------------------
 1. IJPEG distribution release 6b(libjpeg.a). The "official" site 
    for this is ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz


 2. ZLIB 1.1.3(libz.a) distribution.  

System Requirements
-------------------
 To build the HDF library from source, you need:

   * an ANSI C compiler. The native ANSI compilers on the above 
     platforms are supported. On platforms where no ANSI compiler
     was available the free GNU ANSI compiler GCC was used.

   * a Fortran 77 (F90 for Crays) compiler if you want Fortran support.
     You can compile both libraries without Fortran support by setting 
     the Fortran compiler variable 'FC = NONE' in the respective
     makefile fragment(mh-<os>) found in the top-level 'config'
     directory. See the INSTALL file for further details on 
     configuration and installation.

Configuring/Testing/Installing 
------------------------------
 See the INSTALL file for instructions on configuring,
 testing and installing for Unix and non-UNIX systems.

DOCUMENTATION/FAQ/HELP
----------------------
 The HDF documentation can be found on the NCSA ftp server
 in the directory /HDF/HDF/Documentation.  The HDF home page is at:

      http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/

 An FAQ is available on our ftp server, as well as under
 "Information about HDF" in the home page.
