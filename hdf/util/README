In this directory there are hdf utility programs, the makefiles, and a 
subdirectory testfiles/ which contains all the data files needed to test
the utilities. The README.UTILS file describes how to use the data files
in testfiles/ to test the utilities. 

The utilities are:

    . hdf24to8 -- converts 24-bit raster images to hdf 8-bit images

    . hdfcomp -- re-compress 8-bit raster hdf file
   
    . hdfls -- lists basci information about an hdf file

    . hdfpack --  compacts an hdf file

    . hdftopal -- extracts a palette from an hdf file
  
    . hdftor8 -- exatracts 8-bit raster images and palettes from an
                 hdf file

    . hdfed -- hdf file editor

    . paltohdf -- converts a raw palette to hdf

    . r8tohdf -- converts 8-bit raster images to hdf

    . ristosds -- converts a series raster image hdf files into a
                  single 3D sds hdf file. 

    . vcompat -- converts hdf vset v1.0 files to v2.0

    . vmake -- creates vsets 

    . vshow -- dumps out vsets in a hdf file

    . jpegtohdf -- converts jpeg images to hdf raster images

    . hdftojpeg -- converts hdf raster images to jpeg images

    . fp2hdf -- converts 2D and 3D floating point data sets into HDF SDS.


Hdfrseq, which displays images, has been moved to /HDF/contrib/NCSA/hdfrseq/.
