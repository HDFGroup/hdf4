***********************************************************************
			NCSA HDF version 3.3
***********************************************************************

     ---------------- Invoking the Makefile ------------------ 

A Makefile is provided for building HDF3.3.  Open the Makefile
in your editor and read the instructions at the top of the file.
The section marked PORTING INSTRUCTIONS indicates that you need
to modify certain lines in order to configure the Makefile for your
particular system.

Make targets available are :
make            -- compile and install library 
make all        -- compile and install library
make libdf.a    -- compile library
make nofortran  -- compile and install library, only C interface
make libnostub  -- same as make nofortran
make libnofortran  -- compile library and only C interface
make install_it    -- install library 
make clean      -- rm intermediate files
make cleanup    -- rm all make products


    --------------- Compiling Subsets of HDF ---------------

In order to use HDF, you must compile the C routines using the
following modules: hfile.c, hfile.h, hdf.h, hdfi.h, herr.c, herr.h,
hkit.c and hproto.h.  You can omit various other routines by
deleting references to certain files from the makefile, as
follows:

 To omit selected fortran interfaces, delete all references to
     fortran files that contain those interfaces (xxx.f) and 
     their object files (xxx.o).

Similarly:

  To omit DFR8 routines, delete files that begin dfr8...
  To omit DF24 routines, delete files that begin df24...
  To omit DFP  routines, delete files that begin dfp...
  To omit DFSD routines, delete files that begin dfsd...
  To omit DFAN routines, delete files that begin dfan...
  To omit Vset routines, delete files that begin v...
  To omit conversion routines (currently only used by DFSD
     and Vset), delete files that begin dfconv...
  To omit the routines that emulate the old lower layer
     of HDF, delete df.h, dfi.h, df.c, dfF.c and dfFf.f


     ------------ Compiling C programs with HDF ----------------

To use HDF routines in your program, you must have the line
'#include "hdf.h"' near the beginning of your code.  You may also
need to include additional header files (eg. dfrig.h or dfsd.h, etc),
depending on the interfaces you are using.  Call the appropriate
HDF routines as described in the documentation. 
Compile a C program called "myprog.c" as follows:

    cc myprog.c libdf.a -o myprog
or
    cc myprog.c -o myprog -ldf

If the include files are in the directory "incdir", and the 
library file "libdf.a" is in "libdir", use

    cc -Iincdir myprog.c libdir/libdf.a -o myprog
or
    cc -Iincdir myprog.c -o myprog -L libdir -ldf


    ------------ Testing HDF ----------------

A partial test suite should be included in this distribution.
A Makefile and instructions are included with this test suite.
