This directory contains the test suite for the basic library libdf.a.
After running the make file at either the higher level or this level,
you will find two executable programs, testhdf and fortest, in this 
directory. Testhdf tests the C functions, while fortest the Fortran 
interface. At the end of execution, each program reports how many 
errors happened. Please contact us at hdfhelp@ncsa.uiuc.edu 
if the test fails on your machine.
