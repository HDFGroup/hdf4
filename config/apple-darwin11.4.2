# This file is part of the HDF4 build script. It is processed shortly
# after configure starts and defines, among other things, flags for
# the various compilation modes.

# Choosing C, Fortran, and C++ Compilers
# --------------------------------------
#
# The user should be able to specify the compiler by setting the CC, F77,
# and CXX environment variables to the name of the compiler and any
# switches it requires for proper operation. If CC is unset then this
# script may set it. If CC is unset by time this script completes then
# configure will try `gcc' and `cc' in that order (perhaps some others
# too).
#
# Note: Code later in this file may depend on the value of $CC_BASENAME
#       in order to distinguish between different compilers when
#       deciding which compiler command-line switches to use.  This
#       variable is set based on the incoming value of $CC and is only
#       used within this file.

# This is for Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), aka Darwin 11.4.
