After Installation
===========================================================================
The compressed examples file HDF4Examples-0.1.1-Source.@BINARY_EXAMPLE_ENDING@, located in the 
HDF4 install folder, can be built and tested with CMake and the supplied
HDF4_Examples.cmake file. The HDF4_Examples.cmake expects HDF4 to have
been installed in the default location with above compilers. Also, CMake 2.8.12 
and 7Zip utilities should be installed.

To test the installation with the examples;
    Create a directory to run the examples.
    Copy HDF4Examples-0.1.1-Source.@BINARY_EXAMPLE_ENDING@ to this directory, do NOT unzip.
    Copy HDF4_Examples.cmake to this directory.
    Edit HDF4_Examples.cmake line 8 to set INSTALLDIR to where HDF4 is installed.
    Execute from this directory: 
        ctest -S HDF4_Examples.cmake,HDF4Examples-0.1.1-Source -C Release -O test.log -VV

When executed, the ctest script will save the results to the log file, test.log, as
indicated by the ctest command. If you wish the to see more build and test information, 
add "-VV" to the ctest command. The output should show;
      100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 49.

For more information see USING_CMake_Examples.txt in the install folder.
