The compressed examples file HDF4Examples-0.1.1-Source.@BINARY_EXAMPLE_ENDING@, located in the 
HDF4 install folder, can be built and tested with CMake and the supplied
HDF4_Examples.cmake file. The HDF4_Examples.cmake expects HDF4 to have
been installed in the default location with above compilers.

To test the installation with the examples;
    Create a directory to run the examples.
    Copy HDF4Examples-0.1.1-Source.@BINARY_EXAMPLE_ENDING@ to this directory, do NOT unzip.
    Copy HDF4_Examples.cmake to this directory.
    Edit HDF4_Examples.cmake line 8 to set INSTALLDIR to where HDF4 is installed.
    Execute from this directory: 
        ctest -S HDF4_Examples.cmake,HDF4Examples-0.1.1-Source -C Release -O test.log -VV

When executed, the ctest script will save the results to the log file, test.log, as
indicated by the ctest command. If you wish the to see more build and test information, 
add "-VV" to the ctest command.
