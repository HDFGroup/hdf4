# To be used by projects that make use of CMakeified hdf-@HDF4_PACKAGE_VERSION@

#
# Find the HDF4 includes and get all installed hdf4 library settings from
# HDF4-config.cmake file : Requires a CMake compatible hdf-@HDF4_PACKAGE_VERSION@ or later 
# for this feature to work. The following vars are set if hdf4 is found.
#
# HDF4_FOUND               - True if found, otherwise all other vars are undefined
# HDF4_INCLUDE_DIR         - The include dir for main *.h files
# HDF4_FORTRAN_INCLUDE_DIR - The include dir for fortran modules and headers
# HDF4_VERSION_STRING      - full version (e.g. @HDF4_PACKAGE_VERSION@)
# HDF4_VERSION_MAJOR       - major part of version (e.g. @HDF4_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR@)
# HDF4_VERSION_MINOR       - minor part (e.g. @HDF4_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR@)
# 
# The following boolean vars will be defined
# HDF4_ENABLE_PARALLEL - 1 if HDF4 parallel supported
# HDF4_BUILD_FORTRAN   - 1 if HDF4 was compiled with fortran on
# HDF4_BUILD_CPP_LIB   - 1 if HDF4 was compiled with cpp on
# HDF4_BUILD_TOOLS     - 1 if HDF4 was compiled with tools on
# 
# Target names that are valid (depending on enabled options)
# will be the following
#
# hdf              : HDF4 C library
# hdf_f90cstub     : used by Fortran to C interface
# hdf_fortran      : Fortran HDF4 library
# mfhdf            : HDF4 multi-file C interface library
# xdr              : RPC library
# mfhdf_f90cstub   : used by Fortran to C interface to multi-file library
# mfhdf_fortran    : Fortran multi-file library
#

# HDF4_ROOT_DIR_HINT to the location where @HDF4_PACKAGE@@HDF_PACKAGE_EXT@-config.cmake lies
