		README for the HDF hdp directory

This directory contains source and data files for hdp, an HDF dumper.
File hdp.txt explains hdp commands and command options. Hdp will be
automatically compiled and installed when you run 'make' and
'make install' from the top level.

A file named testhdf.sh and a group of .hdf files are included for 
testing.   Run the test with the command "make test".

Please send your bug reports, comments and suggestions to 
hdfhelp@hdfgroup.org
