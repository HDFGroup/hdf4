# This file is for customizing the configuation process performed by
# `./configuration'.  This file consists of sh(1) variable-definition lines.
# The value given to those variables by this file will override their default
# values.
#
# You can also customize the configuration process via the environment
# variables seen by ./configure.  For example:
#
#     In csh(1):
#	  % setenv CC acc
#	  & setenv CFLAGS -g
#	  % ./configure
#
#     In sh(1):
#	  $ CC=acc CFLAGS=-g ./configure
#
# Variables in this file override the environmental ones.
