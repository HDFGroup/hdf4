   Name: test_file_inuse() - tests preventing of an in-use file being
                removed at cleanup time.
                (bugzilla #376)

   Description:
    Sometime, when an error occurs, the cleanup process attempts to
    remove a file, which might still be in use (part of bugzilla #376.)
    The routine test_file_inuse is to test the fix that provides the
    underlying call to HPisfile_in_use, which should successfully
    determines whether a file is still in use before an attempt to remove.

    The main contents include:
    - a loop that repeatedly calls SDstart/DFACC_CREATE; only the first
    SDstart succeeds, the subsequent ones should fail.
    - SDcreate, SDwritedata, SDendaccess follow
    - outside of that loop is another loop to call SDend corresponding
    to the previous SDstart's
    - then, at the end, the file will be reopened; if the file doesn't
    exist and causes SDstart to fail, the test will fail.

    Before the fix, when the 2nd SDstart/DFACC_CREATE was called and
    failed because the file was being in use from the first call to
    SDstart/DFACC_CREATE, the cleaning process removed the file.

   Return value:
    The number of errors occurred in this routine.

   Name: test_max_open_files() - tests the new API SDreset_maxopenfiles,
                SDget_maxopenfiles, SDget_numopenfiles,
                and SDgetfilename.
                (bugzilla #396 and #440)

   Description:
    There were multiple requests from the users to increase the maximum
    number of opened files allowed.  SDreset_maxopenfiles is added to
    allow the user to reset that value.  The current default value is 32.
    This API can be called anytime to increase it.  This test routine will
    carry out the following tests:

    - Get the current max, should be the default (32,) and the system limit
    - Reset current max to an arbitrary number that is larger than the
    default and verify
    - Try to create more files than the current max and all should
    succeed, because NC_open resets the current max to system limit
    automatically, when the number of opened files exceeds the current
    max
    - Get the current max and system limit and verify, current max
    should be the system limit
    - Get the current max another way, it should be the system limit again
    - Get the current number of files being opened
    - Reset current max to a value that is smaller than the current
    number of opened files; it shouldn't reset
    - Reset current max again to a value that is smaller than the
    current max but larger than the current number of opened files,
    that should work for there is no information loss
    - Try to create more files up to the system limit or NUM_FILES_HI,
    because the arrays have max NUM_FILES_HI elements in this test
    - Close all the files, then try opening all again to verify their
    names, this is to test bugzilla 440

   Return value:
    The number of errors occurred in this routine.
