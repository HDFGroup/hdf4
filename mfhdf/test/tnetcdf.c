/********************************************************************
   Name: test_read_dim() - tests reading a dimension scale in a netCDF file.

   Description:
        The fix to detect a dimension scale/coordinate variable in HDF file
	caused incorrect result when attempting to retrieve the dimension
	scale's number type from a netCDF file (bugzilla #1644.)
	This test verifies that the number type of dimension scale is
	retrieved correctly after the fix.

   Return value:
        The number of errors occurred in this routine.
