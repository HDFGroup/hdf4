This is the minimum subset of RPCSRC 3.9 needed to build the netcdf library.
It is included here for those systems which lack xdr support.
If your system already has these xdr routines, by all means use them.
Unix systems which suport the Network File System (NFS) usually have these
routines in the 'c' library, /usr/lib/libc.a,
so you don't need to link in any additional libraries.
Another candididate is librpclib.a in /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib.

The complete RPCSRC distribution may be obtained from Sun or
from the sun-spots archive at rice.edu.

If you must build this portion of the system, make xdrtest. 
Running it should produce output like the contents of
testout.sav on standard output.
N.B **** For the double precision numbers, the last three
decimal digits will vary between vaxes and ieee machines. *****
Running xdrtest will also produce the file "test.xdr".
Once standard out looks good, then do a binary comparison of the
files "test.xdr" and "test_xdr.sav".
(On unix you enter, 'cmp test.xdr test_xdr.sav').
If the files are byte for byte identical, you are okay.


On VAX/VMS, you WILL probably have to build this directory.
The following files are only used on vms:
	descrip.mms - The immoral equivalent of a Makefile
	htonl.mar - 'Host To Network Long', in VAX Macro
	ntohl.mar - 'Network To Host Long', in VAX Macro
Because the stdio implementation in vax C runtime library is so poor,
this code runs 3 times slower on vms than under Ultrix on the same
Microvax.  If someone were very civic minded they would rewrite the
file xdrstdio.c as xdr_qio.c. (This is not as bad as it sounds,
the similar thing has already been done for MacOS Toolbox calls.)
The file netcdf/src/file.c would also need to be changed ...
Otherwise, hammer on DEC to get there C language support together.


Notes:

The return value of xdr_getpos and the corresponding argument to xdr_setpos
changed from 'u_int' to 'u_long' (fpos_t??) in anticipation of problems
on micros where sizeof(int) < sizeof(long). OK with Steve Nahm at sun.


Thu Mar  9 22:23:00 MDT 1989

Added support for architectures where sizeof(enum) == sizeof(char)
in xdr.c:xdr_enum. Note that, as written this is a runtime !?! check...

The Iris computers seem to put the xdr routines in /usr/lib/libsun.a.
EG, you don't need to build the ones here.
You may have to muck around to get the include files right on an iris.
Also may need libbsd.a.


Wed Apr 26 19:48:46 MDT 1989

Fix to xdr_float.c:xdr_float:"#ifdef vax" to handle values less than 
2^^-127 properly.


May 1989

Added MIPSEL #ifdef for ieee, byte swapped machines like DECstations.
