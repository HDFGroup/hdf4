* Build and Test HDF4 Examples with CMake                              *
************************************************************************

Notes: This short instruction is written for users who want to quickly 
       test the installation of HDF4 by using the CMake tools to build
       and test the HDF4 Examples. The following instructions will show
       the default usage and then present common changes for non-default
       installations.
       For more information, see the USING_HDF4_CMake.txt file.
       
       More information about using CMake can be found at the KitWare 
       site, www.cmake.org.
         
       CMake uses the command line and these instructions use the script
       method of the ctest command.


========================================================================
I. Preconditions                                                           
========================================================================

   1. We suggest you obtain the latest CMake for windows from the Kitware
      web site. The HDF 4.2.x product requires a minimum CMake version 
      of 3.1.0.
                                                                         
   2. You have installed the HDF4 library built with CMake by executing 
      the HDF Install Utility (the *.exe file in the binary package for 
      Windows or the *.sh on Linux). If you are using a Windows platform, 
      you can obtain a pre-built Windows binary from The HDF Group's website 
      at www.hdfgroup.org. See Section "III. Common changes to the 
      HDF4_Examples.cmake file", for the line to change the location.
                                                                         
   3. On Windows, you have installed the 7Zip package. See Section "III. 
      Common changes to the HDF4_Examples.cmake file", for the line to 
      change the command.



========================================================================
II. Building HDF4 Examples with CMake
========================================================================

Files in the HDF4 install directory:
       HDF4Examples-0.1.1-Source.zip (or HDF4Examples-0.1.1-Source.tar.gz)
       HDF4_Examples.cmake
       
Default installation process:
       Create a directory to run the examples, i.e. \test_hdf4.
       Copy HDF4Examples-0.1.1-Source.zip(.tar.gz) to this directory, do NOT unzip.
       Copy HDF4_Examples.cmake to this directory.
       Edit line 8 of the HDF4_Examples.cmake file and change the INSTALLDIR 
           to the HDF4 install location.
       
       Execute from this directory:
          ctest -S HDF4_Examples.cmake,HDF4Examples-0.1.1-Source -C Release -O test.log

The script will uncompress the examples file HDF4Examples-0.1.1-Source.zip(.tar.gz),
   and create a build directory inside the HDF4Examples-0.1.1-Source directory.
   It will then configure, build, and execute the examples. All the log files
   will be found under the build\Testing\Temporary directory, check these for
   errors.
   
The amount of script information can be increased by adding -V to the ctest
   command. Even more information can be shown by adding -VV instead of -V.


========================================================================
III. Common changes to the HDF4_Examples.cmake file
========================================================================

Line 8: change the INSTALLDIR to a different HDF4 install location.

Line 14: uncomment to allow Mac machines to build shared examples.

Line 15: uncomment to build and test Fortran examples.

Line 16: comment to use an existing source directory.

Line 70: change the CTEST_7Z_COMMAND to a different unzip program.
