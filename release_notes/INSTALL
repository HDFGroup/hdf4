========================================================================
I. Preconditions
========================================================================
Obtaining HDF4 source code
   1. Create a directory for your development; for example, "myhdfstuff".

   2. Obtain HDF4 source from Github
         development branch:  https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf4
         last release:        https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf4/releases/latest
             hdf-4_2_"X".tar.gz or hdf-4_2_"X".zip

      and put it in "myhdfstuff".
      Uncompress the file. There should be a hdf-4.2."X" folder.

II. HDF4 Precompiled Binaries
========================================================================
The HDF Group provides pre-compiled binaries from the Github Releases page:
    development snapshots:  https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf4/releases/tag/snapshot
    last release:           https://github.com/HDFGroup/hdf4/releases/latest

    OSX 12 with clang:                *-osx12.tar.gz
    Ubuntu 22.04 with gcc:            *-ubuntu-2204_gcc.tar.gz
    Ubuntu 22.04 with Intel OneAPI:   *-ubuntu-2204_intel.tar.gz

========================================================================
III. Additional Third-party Software Requirements
========================================================================
   1.  Flex and Bison programs are required to regenerate the ncgen parsers.
       This is not required to build the library and is only necessary if you
       change the input files.
   
       A.  The Win flex-bison project, a port of Flex & Bison tools 
           to the Windows platform, is recommended. Download from:
               http://sourceforge.net/projects/winflexbison
    
       B.  CMake version 3.12 or higher is needed to use Win flex-bison. 
           Using an earlier version of CMake will require renaming the executables
           without the "win_" prefix.


See RELEASE.txt in the release_notes/ directory for the list of platforms 
tested for this release.

Instructions for building and testing HDF4 using CMake can be found in the
INSTALL_CMake.txt file found in this folder.

Instructions for building and testing HDF4 using autotools can be found in the
INSTALL_Auto.txt file found in this folder.
