         HDF4 Build and Install Instructions for Cygwin
************************************************************************

This document is a instruction on how to build, test and install HDF4 libary on 
Cygwin.  See detailed information in hdf4/INSTALL. 

NOTE: hdf4 can be built with CMake, see the INSTALL_CMake.txt file for more guidance.

Preconditions:
--------------

1. Installed Cygwin 1.7.32 or higher

   To install the Cygwin net release, go to http://www.cygwin.com and 
   click on "setup-x86.exe" (32-bit installation) under the heading
    "Current Cygwin DLL version". This will download a GUI 
   installer called setup-x86.exe which can be run to download a complete 
   Cygwin installation via the internet. Then follow the instructions 
   on each screen to install Cygwin.

   Cygwin uses packages to manage installing various software. Users can 
   choose to install or uninstall certain packages by running setup.exe.
   http://www.cygwin.com/packages/ provides detailed information about 
   Cygwin packages.

   Most required dependencies can be satisfied by installing all packages in
   the "Devel" category.  However, please verify that you have installed all
   packages listed below.

2. Compilers, Libraries and Utilities Installed

   2.1 Compilers Supported
    
    The following compilers are supported by HDF4 and included in the Cygwin
    package system:
       gcc (4.8.3), which includes:
            gcc4-core    : C compiler
            gcc4-g++     : C++ compiler
            gcc4-fortran : fortran compiler
            

   2.1.1 Using Compilers Not Supported
       
       By default the current configuration uses vendor compilers; to use
        another compiler run the following commands before running
        configure: 
 
        setenv CC   "foo -flags"
        setenv F77  "fffoo -flags"
 
        See the configure help page (configure --help) for a list of
        environment variables that have an affect on building the
        library.
        
    2.2 Libraries Installed
    
    The following libraries are required to build HDF4:
    
        libjpeg-devel   : JPEG library (either 6b or 8b)
        tirpc           : RPC library
        zlib            : Zlib compression library

    Back in 2005, the SunRPC of the glibc has been replaced by a TI-RPC 
    (Transport Independent RPC) library to support IPv6. Note that HDF4 configure 
    expects to find the library with the name libtirpc.a, since Cygwin 1.7.7.

    HDF4 also requires xdr support which is not provided by the Cygwin
    version of tirpc.  HDF4 provides a library for xdr support when the 
    configure flag --enable-hdf4-xdr is specified (see note 3 in the section
    "Build, Test and Install HDF4 on Cygwin").
    
    HDF4 may be configured to use the SZIP compression Library.
    For more information about the SZIP library, see

               https://hdfgroup.org/doc_resource/SZIP/ 

    The SZIP compression library is free for non-commercial use; 
    see https://hdfgroup.org/doc_resource/SZIP/Commercial_szip.html
    for information regarding commercial use.   

    
    2.3 Additional Utilities
    
    The following standard utilities are also required to build and test HDF4:
        
        bison           : yacc implementation
        diffutils       : diff command
        flex            : flex utility
        make            : make utility
    
    2.4 Alternate Build Process
    
    Download the CMake package and follow the notes in the "INSTALL_CMake.txt" 
    file to build HDF4 with the CMake utilities.
        
        
        
Build, Test and Install HDF4 on Cygwin
--------------------------------------

Notes: Use the configure command in the top level HDF4 directory.

1. HDF4 Source code
     
   HDF provides "tar source ball" from the HDF ftp server in the directory:

         ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF/HDF_Current/src

   Please note that HDF no longer provides precompiled binaries for Cygwin.

2. Unpacking the distribution

   gzip -cd <HDF-X.Y.Z.tar.gz>| tar xvf -

3. To configure 
     
       ./configure <--disable-fortran> 
                   --enable-hdf4-xdr
                   --with-zlib=/path_to_ZLIB_install_directory 
                   --with-jpeg=/path_to_JPEG_install_directory 
                   <--with-szlib=/path_to_SZIP_install_directory>
                   --prefix=/path_to_HDF4_install_directory

       * Please note that when szlib option is not used, SZIP Library will not
         be configured in and SZIP compression will not be enabled.
       * If your system has ZLIB and/or JPEG libraries installed under a
         system library directory (such as /usr/lib), configure will
         automatically find the library. In this case, the corresponding
         configure flag may be omitted.
       * Note that --prefix defines where the installation path is.
         The default is set as <hdf4_build_directory>/hdf4 

4. To Build and Test:

  4.1 To build the library

        make >& make.out

  4.2 To build and run the tests

        make check >& check.out

5. To Install:

        make install

6. To test the installation:

	make installcheck
