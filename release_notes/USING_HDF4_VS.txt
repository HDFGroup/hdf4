These suggestions are for Visual Studio users.

Instructions for building and testing HDF4 applications using CMake can 
be found in the USING_HDF4_CMake.txt file found in this folder.

The following two sections are helpful if you do not use CMake to build 
your applications.

Using Visual Studio 2010 with HDF4 Libraries Built with Visual Studio 2010
==========================================================================

   1. Set up the path to the external libraries and headers.

      The path settings will need to be in the project property sheets per 
      project. Go to "Project" and select "Properties", find "Configuration 
      Properties", and then "VC++ Directories".
          
      1.1 If you are building on 64-bit Windows, find the "Platform" dropdown
          and select "x64".
              
      1.2 Add the header path to the "Include Directories" setting.
          
      1.3 Add the library path to the "Library Directories" setting.
          
      1.4 Select Linker->Input and beginning with the
          "Additional Dependencies" line, enter the library names. The
          external libraries should be listed first followed by the HDF4
          libraries. For example, enter:

          jpeg.lib szip.lib zlib.lib hdfdll.lib mfhdfdll.lib

   2. Set up the path to the external libraries and headers

      Invoke Microsoft Visual Studio and go to "Tools" and select "Options", 
      find "Projects", and then "VC++ Directories".
      
      2.1 If you are building on 64-bit Windows, find the "Platform" dropdown
          and select "x64".

      2.2 Find the box "Show directories for", choose "Include files", add the 
          header path (i.e., c:\Program Files\HDF_Group\HDF4\1.8.x\include)
          to the included directories.

      2.3 Find the box "Show directories for", choose "Library files", add the
          library path (i.e., c:\Program Files\HDF_Group\HDF4\1.8.x\lib)
          to the library directories.
          
      2.4 For Fortran libraries, you will also need to setup the path for 
          the Intel Fortran compiler.
          
      2.5 Select Project->Properties->Linker->Input and beginning with the
          "Additional Dependencies" line, enter the library names. The
          external libraries should be listed first followed by the HDF4
          libraries. For example, enter:

          jpeg.lib szip.lib zlib.lib hdfdll.lib mfhdfdll.lib
