CM5 Parallel I/O Extension

    Tests of the CM5 parallel I/O extension of the SDS interface 
    have resulted in about a 25 MBytes/second IO throughput using the 
    SDA (Scalable Disk Array) file system. The library provides 
    interfaces for both C* and CMF programming languages.

    Read the section "Installing HDF Libraries With CM5 Parallel I/O
    Extension" below for specific installation instructions.

    The parallel I/O interface requires the scientific dataset be
    stored as external elements and the I/O access type be set to
    "Parallel" before reading or writing the dataset.  Read the manual
    pages for SDsetexternalfile and SDsetaccesstype for details.  The
    mfhdf/CM5/Examples directory contains program examples in C* and
    CMF.  The extension is coded in C* but used the CMFS library.  It
    is a bit complex to link it with CMF programs.  The Examples
    directory also contains a Makefile showing how to compile and link
    in the runtime libraries.

    The hdfls and hdfpack utilities have options to handle them. The
    hdfunpac utility is used for external file handling also.
    See the man pages for details.

    A note: C* does not support the "nopadding" option that CMF does.
    CMF programs compiled with "-nopadding" (default is padding) do
    not work with the parallel I/O extension.

Installing HDF Libraries With CM5 Parallel I/O Extension

    It takes two major steps to install the HDF libraries.

    1) Compile and install the ordinary HDF libraries, include files
    and utilities according to the instructions for a SunOS machine.

    2) To make the HDF library with CM5 parallel IO extension:  There
    are two new libraries, libdfcm5.a and libmfhdfcm5.a, which are
    similar to libdf.a and libmfhdf.a.

    Configuration

	make distclean	        # remove any files created in the previous make
	./configure CM5

    Compile

	make libdf libmfhdf     # create the two parallel IO libraries

    Install
	# Install it in system area such as /usr/local/lib
	cp hdf/src/libdf.a /usr/local/lib/libdfcm5.a
	ranlib /usr/local/lib/libdfcm5.a
	cp mfhdf/libsrc/libmfhdf.a /usr/local/lib/libmfhdfcm5.a
	ranlib /usr/local/lib/libmfhdfcm5.a
