HDF version 4.2.12 released on 2016-06-29
====================================================

INTRODUCTION

This document describes the differences between HDF 4.2.11 and HDF 4.2.12.
It is written for people who are familiar with previous releases of HDF
and wish to migrate to HDF 4.2.12.

The HDF 4.2.11 documentation can be found on the The HDF Group's website
at:
    https://www.hdfgroup.org/release4/doc/

First-time HDF users are encouraged to read the HDF FAQ, which can be
reached from the HDF product home page:

    https://hdfgroup.org/products/hdf4/

If you have any questions or comments, please see the HDF Support page:

    https://hdfgroup.org/services/support.html

CONTENTS

- New features and changes
  -- Configuration
- Support for new platforms and compilers
- Bugs fixed since HDF 4.2.11
  -- Configuration
  -- Library
  -- Utilities
- Documentation
- Platforms tested
- Known problems


New features and changes
========================
   Configuration
   =============
    - None

   Library
   =========
    - Behavior of HDstrdup changed
      HDstrdup now checks the input string for NULL.  (BMR, 2016/05/12)

    - Behavior of SDsetexternalfile changed
      Previously, when SDsetexternalfile was called more than once on a data
      set, the library would repeatedly store the external file information in
      the main file, at different offsets.  SDsetexternalfile is now fixed to
      cause no effect when the data set is already external.  (BMR, 2016/05/30)

    - Added new utility function HDisnetcdf64 for use in tools
      HDisnetcdf64 returns TRUE(1) or FALSE(0) if a file is a netCDF 64-bit
      file or not.
	intn HDisnetcdf64(const char *filename)
      (BMR, 2016/06/14)


   Utilities
   =========
    - hdp: detection of netCDF 64-bit file
      The utility hdp simply failed when the input file was a netCDF 64-bit
      file.  It now reports that it cannot read a netCDF 64-bit file then
      exits or continue to the next input file.
      (BMR, 2016/06/14)


Support for new platforms and compilers
=======================================
    - Support for Mac OS X Yosemeti 10.10 added (AKC - 2015/03/04, HDFFR-1500)

    - Support for Mac OS X El Capitan 10.11 added (AKC - 2015/11/18, HDFFR-1425)
      (BMR, added for AKC, 2016/06/24)

    Java Wrapper Library
    --------------------

    The Java HDF JNI library has been integrated into the HDF repository.
    The configure option is "--enable-java", and the CMake option is
    HDF4_BUILD_JAVA:BOOL=ON. The package hierarchy has changed from the
    HDF 4 JNI, which was "ncsa.hdf.hdflib", to HDF 4.2.12,
    "hdf.hdflib".


Bugs fixed since HDF 4.2.11
=========================
   Configuration
   =============
    - Examples from mfhdf and hdf will now be installed according to $DESTDIR when
      it is supplied.  (LRK, 2016/06/29, HDFFR-1491)

   Library
   =========
    - SDsetexternalfile on special elements
      When the data element is already special, incorrect data length was used
      for the element in subsequent calls to SDsetexternalfile, causing
      failures sometimes.  This is now fixed.  (BMR, 2016/01/04, HDFFR-1516)


   Utilities
   =========
    - None


Documentation
=============
    - In addition to minor improvements in the contents, user documentation
      have a new format to improve usability.
      (BMR, 2016/06/24)

Known problems
==============
o  Several Fortran examples print "^@" when displaying strings (for example,
   names of the attributes). This happens because Fortran application
   doesn't know the length of the strings passed from the C library.
   EIP - 2015-01-11, HDFFR-1477

o  CMake builds in Windows uses the same pre-generated ncgen*.[ch] files from
   the yacc/lex input files. The generated file, ncgenyy.c, uses the <unistd.h>
   header file that Windows does not support.  This must be blocked out in
   order for Windows to use it.
   AKC 2014-02-03, HDFFR-1424

o  CMake "make install" fails installing the tools:
    Use CPack to create an install package.
   ADB - 2014/02/03

o  CMake does not install these man pages:
    hdf.1, ncdump.1, ncgen.1
   AKC/BMR - 2014/02/02

o  For Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, 10.8 Mountain Lion, 10.9 Mavericks, 10.10 Yosemite,
   and 10.11 El Capitan, when compiling with -O2, some xdr functions might cause
   memory corruption.  This happened for GCC, Intel and Clang compilers.
   Currently, -O0 level optimization is used to avoid this problem.
   (HDFFR-1318,1327,1358,1425) EIP - 2013/02/05, BMR - 2016/06/24

o  On IBM PowerPC 64, hdftest fails when gcc 4.4.6 is used with -O3 optimization
   level.

o  When building in AIX systems, if CC is xlc with -qlanglvl=ansi, configure
   will fail when checking for the jpeglib.h header due to the duplicated
   macro definition of HAVE_STDLIB_H.  This is because some newer builds
   of the jpeg library have HAVE_STDLIB_H defined in the jconfig.h header file.
   Without the -qlanglvl=ansi, some older xlc versions (e.g., V7.0) still
   fail, but newer xlc versions (e.g., V9.0) pass.  AKC - 2010/02/17

o  When building on Linux/UNIX platforms, the szip shared library files must
   be in the system library path.  This can be done by adding a link to
   the libsz.* files in the /usr/lib folder or by adding the library
   location to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
      Ex. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path_to_szip_lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   Optionally, one can use the static szip library files by adding '-static'
   to the CFLAGS environment variable.

o  Existing data written by an HDF4 Library prior to HDF 4.2r2:
   When a one-dimensional SDS and a dimension scale have
   the same name, subsequent accesses to the dimension scale or to the
   SDS might produce undesired results because the libraries could not
   distinguish between the two objects.  In the case of writing, data
   might even be corrupted.  For example, SDS data might be written to a
   dimension variable or vice versa. (bugzilla #624)

   HDF4 Library Releases 4.2r2 and later make a distinction between an SDS
   and a dimension variable.  However, as with older versions, these recent
   versions are unable to detect such conflicts in files created by earlier
   releases.  It is therefore STRONGLY recommended to check for such name
   duplication before working with data created with a pre-4.2r2 library.

   The functions SDgetnumvars_byname and SDnametoindices are provided
   to help detect such name conflicts and select the correct object to
   access, respectively; see the HDF Reference Manual entries for
   further details.
   FB - 2009/01/26
   BMR - revised 2011/06/24

o  N-bit compression is not supported with Fortran APIs.

o  Using both fill-value and compression on SD datasets does not work.

o  When using PGI compilers, make sure that the JPEG library is also compiled
   with a PGI C compiler; linking with a JPEG library built with gcc causes
   JPEG library tests to fail.  To bypass the problem:

       x Set LIBS flag to $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a
         where $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR points to the installation directory
         for the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         setenv LIBS $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a

       x Use the --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR configure flag to
         configure with the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         ./configure --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR --with-zlib....

o  In order for the API SDgetdatasize to get the correct compressed size
   of the data, the dataset needs to be closed (SDendaccess) or read
   (SDreaddata) after being written and before SDgetdatasize is called.

New features and changes
========================
   Configuration
   ============= 
    - None
     

Support for new platforms and compilers
=======================================
    - None


Bugs fixed since HDF 4.2.10
=========================
   Configuration
   =============
    - Windows installer incorrect display of PATH environment variable.
    
      In the Windows installer, the dialog box where the user can elect to
      add the product's bin path to the %PATH% environment variable displayed
      an incorrect path. This path was missing the C:\Program Files part
      and used the POSIX file separator '/' before the bin (<path>/bin,
      instead of <path>\bin).
      
      The dialog box text was changed to simply say that the product's bin
      path would be added instead of explicitly displaying the path.
      This is in line with most installers. The reason for not fixing the 
      displayed path instead is that it is difficult to pass the correct
      path from CPack to the NSIS installer for display.

      Note that this was never a code issue - it was just a display
      problem. The installer always did the right thing when updating the
      environment variable.

      (DER - 2014/11/14, HDFFV-9016)

   Library
   ========= 
    - Warning "array subscript is below array bounds"

      Applied user's patch to remove the warning.

      (BMR 2014/06/02, HDFFR-1379)


   Utilities
   ========= 
    - Detection of read failure in ncdump

      Previously, ncdump did not detect failure from ncvarget because the
      returned value from ncvarget was not checked, and the calling function
      simply returned 0.

      The error code ERR_READFAIL (-2) is added to ncdump only to indicate this
      failure within ncdump, which will display this message:

      "Reading failed for variable <Variable name>, the data is possibly corrupted."

      (BMR 2015/01/21, HDFFR-1468)

    - Improvement of the ncgen's usage statement.

      Previously, ncgen's usage looked like this:
      ncgen: -: Usage: ncgen [-V] [ -b ] [ -c ] [ -f ] [ -o outfile]  [ file... ]

      More details are added to the usage to improve clarity.  Now, it is more
      clear, and consistent with ncdump, like this:
      Usage: ncgen [-V] [ -b ] [ -c ] [ -f ] [ -o outfile] [ file ... ]
        [-V]             Display version of the HDF4 library and exit
        [-b]             For binary netCDF output, '.nc' extension
        [-c]             For C output
        [-f]             For Fortran output
        [-o <outfile>]   Explicitly specify output file name

      (BMR 2015/01/19, HDFFR-1459)

    - Output of hrepack containing an unnecessary vgroup of class RIG0.0

      When the input file did not have any GR elements, hrepack still opened and
      closed the output file using the GR API, which caused the RIG0.0 vgroup to
      be written to the output file.

      Hrepack now skips accessing the output file using GR API, when the input
      file doesn't have any images and any GR attributes.

    - Compliance with Fedora standard regarding printf/fprintf statements

      Users sent patches for the problem where the format string is missing from
      the printf/fprintf statements.  This is in compliance with Fedora standard.
      For more information, see
		https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Format-Security-FAQ.

      In the context where this problem occurred, the benefit of using puts/fputs
      over printf/fprintf is insignificant.  Thus, the fix was adding "%s" to
      those printf/fprintf statements that don't have the format string instead
      of switching to puts/fputs.

    - Failure of hdp on some hdfeos generated files

      Attribute vdatas created by hdfeos API have the field named "AttrValues".
      The utility functions Vattrhdfsize and VSattrhdfsize, in hdp.c, used
      ATTR_FIELD_NAME ("VALUES") to verify that a vdata is storing an attribute,
      causing failure on some hdfeos generated files.  In addition, when this
      failure occurred, the calling function tried to free allocated resources
      prematurely.

      The check against ATTR_FIELD_NAME and the premature resource deallocation
      are removed.

Known problems
==============
o  Several Fortran examples print "^@" when displaying strings (for example,
   names of the attributes). This happens because Fortran application 
   doesn't know the length of the strings passed from the C library.  
   EIP - 2015-01-11, HDFFR-1477

o  CMake builds in Windows uses the same pre-generated ncgen*.[ch] files from
   the yacc/lex input files. The generated file, ncgenyy.c, uses the <unistd.h>
   header file that Windows does not support.  This must be blocked out in
   order for Windows to use it. 
   AKC 2014-02-03, HDFFR-1424

o  CMake "make install" fails installing the tools:
    Use CPack to create an install package.
   ADB - 2014/02/03

o  CMake does not install these man pages:
	hdf.1, ncdump.1, ncgen.1
   AKC/BMR - 2014/02/02

o  For Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and on 10.8 Mountain Lion, several tests fail with
   GCC, Intel and Clang compilers.  Currently, this situation is detected and
   -O0 level optimization is used.  
   (HDFFR-1318,1358) EIP - 2013/02/05

o  On IBM PowerPC 64, hdftest fails when gcc 4.4.6 is used with -O3 optimization 
   level. 

o  When building in AIX systems, if CC is xlc with -qlanglvl=ansi, configure
   will fail when checking for the jpeglib.h header due to the duplicated
   macro definition of HAVE_STDLIB_H.  This is because some newer builds
   of the jpeg library have HAVE_STDLIB_H defined in the jconfig.h header file.
   Without the -qlanglvl=ansi, some older xlc versions (e.g., V7.0) still 
   fail, but newer xlc versions (e.g., V9.0) pass.  AKC - 2010/02/17

o  When building on Linux/UNIX platforms, the szip shared library files must
   be in the system library path.  This can be done by adding a link to
   the libsz.* files in the /usr/lib folder or by adding the library
   location to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
      Ex. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path_to_szip_lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   Optionally, one can use the static szip library files by adding '-static'
   to the CFLAGS environment variable.
   
o  Existing data written by an HDF4 Library prior to HDF 4.2r2:
   When a one-dimensional SDS and a dimension scale have
   the same name, subsequent accesses to the dimension scale or to the
   SDS might produce undesired results because the libraries could not
   distinguish between the two objects.  In the case of writing, data
   might even be corrupted.  For example, SDS data might be written to a
   dimension variable or vice versa. (bugzilla #624)

   HDF4 Library Releases 4.2r2 and later make a distinction between an SDS
   and a dimension variable.  However, as with older versions, these recent
   versions are unable to detect such conflicts in files created by earlier 
   releases.  It is therefore STRONGLY recommended to check for such name 
   duplication before working with data created with a pre-4.2r2 library.

   The functions SDgetnumvars_byname and SDnametoindices are provided
   to help detect such name conflicts and select the correct object to
   access, respectively; see the HDF Reference Manual entries for
   further details.
   FB - 2009/01/26
   BMR - revised 2011/06/24

o  N-bit compression is not supported with Fortran APIs.

o  Using both fill-value and compression on SD datasets does not work.

o  When using PGI compilers, make sure that the JPEG library is also compiled 
   with a PGI C compiler; linking with a JPEG library built with gcc causes 
   JPEG library tests to fail.  To bypass the problem:

       x Set LIBS flag to $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a
         where $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR points to the installation directory
         for the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         setenv LIBS $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a

       x Use the --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR configure flag to 
         configure with the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         ./configure --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR --with-zlib....

o  In order for the API SDgetdatasize to get the correct compressed size
   of the data, the dataset needs to be closed (SDendaccess) or read
   (SDreaddata) after being written and before SDgetdatasize is called.

New features and changes
========================
   Configuration
   ============= 
   CMake - Added support to create dmg bundles on Mac.
     (ADB 2013/9/12)
   CMake - Added support to use Windows /MT option.
     (ADB 2013/6/10)
     

Support for new platforms and compilers
=======================================
    - Visual Studio 2012 w/ Intel Fortran 13 on Windows 7 and Windows 8
    - Mac OS X Mavericks with clang and gfortran


Bugs fixed since HDF 4.2.9
=========================
   Configuration
   =============
   - Removed the requirement of yacc/lex like tools. The ncgenXXX.* files
     generated files from yacc and lex input files are pre-created in the
     source code to build the ncgen tool. The msoft*.[ch] files were for
     Windows build but was out of dated. Cmake uses the pre-created files
     instead. See known problem below. (AKC 2014/02/02 HDFFR-1419)

   - Removed old Macintosh platform codes that are not used any more.
     (AKC 2014/01/21 HDFFR-1340)

   - Changed Mac platforms to use the Apple supported clang compiler as the
     default C compiler. (AKC 2014/01/15 HDFFR-1318)

   - Removed the following individual platform specific files and have them to
     be produced by configure using corresponding *.in files.
     mfhdf/libsrc/config/netcdf-XXX.h    by mfhdf/libsrc/netcdf.h.in
     mfhdf/fortran/config/ftest-XXX.f    by mfhdf/fortran/ftest.f.in
     mfhdf/fortran/config/jackets-XXX.c  by mfhdf/fortran/jackets.c.in
     mfhdf/fortran/config/netcdf-XXX.inc by mfhdf/fortran/netcdf.inc.in
     (AKC 2013/12/31 HDFFR-1320/476)

   - The following platforms are old and no longer available. Removed their
     support code from the configure files:
     alpha, convex, dec, fujivp, hpux, ia64, irix32, irix4, irix5, irix6, mac,
     solarisx86, sun, t3e, unicos. (AKC 2013/12/26 HDFFR-1320)

   - Removed -Xc (strict ansi standard) from the default CFLAGS of Solaris
     since the latest Sun Compiler version 5.11 and 5.12 have a conflict with
     the system header file. Since the current versions of C compiler should be
     at least ANSI (aka C89) compliant, the removal of -Xc should be safe. This
     also fixes a previous known problem of needing to use -xc99 to build HDF4.
     (AKC 2013/12/20 HDFFR-1361)

   - CMake - Changed name of TGZ_PATH to TGZPATH.
           (ADB 2013/9/12)
   - CMake - Removed extra flag POSIX_SOURCE as it caused failures on Apple Mac
     builds. (ADB 2013/8/7)

   Library
   ========= 
   - SDsetblocksize and VSsetblocksize would not change the block size if
     the sds/vdata did not use linked-block before it was closed.  The
     problem is now fixed.  (BMR 2013/1/15 - HDFFR-1357)

   - Patches from user are applied to the C test to correct an overflow variable
     and to the Fortran source for some missing declarations.
     (BMR/EP 2014/1/15 - HDFFR-1367)

   - Examples GR_write_chunks.c and GR_read_chunks.c were added. 
     (BMR 2014/12/30 - HDFFR-1402)


   Utilities
   ========= 
   - ncdump displayed garbage in place of fill-values when a variable had
     unlimited dimension and had been written with less number of records
     than the largest number of records in the file.  This is now fixed.
     (BMR 2014/12/16 - HDFFR-1390)

Known problems
==============
o  CMake builds in Windows uses the same pre-generated ncgen*.[ch] files from
   the yacc/lex input files. The generated file, ncgenyy.c, uses the <unistd.h>
   header file that Windows does not support.  This must be blocked out in
   order for Windows to use it. (AKC 2014-02-03 HDFFR-1424).

o  CMake "make install" fails installing the tools:
    Use CPack to create an install package.
   ADB - 2014/02/03

o  CMake does not install these man pages:
	hdf.1, ncdump.1, ncgen.1
   AKC/BMR - 2014/02/02

o  For Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and on 10.8 Mountain Lion, several tests fail with
   GCC, Intel and Clang compilers.  Currently, this situation is detected and
   -O0 level optimization is used.  We will work on the issue for the next
   release. (HDFFR-1318,1358) EIP - 2013/02/05

o  On IBM PowerPC 64, hdftest fails when gcc 4.4.6 is used with -O3 optimization 
   level. 

o  When building in AIX systems, if CC is xlc with -qlanglvl=ansi, configure
   will fail when checking for the jpeglib.h header due to the duplicated
   macro definition of HAVE_STDLIB_H.  This is because some newer builds
   of the jpeg library have HAVE_STDLIB_H defined in the jconfig.h header file.
   Without the -qlanglvl=ansi, some older xlc versions (e.g., V7.0) still 
   fail, but newer xlc versions (e.g., V9.0) pass.  AKC - 2010/02/17

o  When building on Linux/UNIX platforms, the szip shared library files must
   be in the system library path.  This can be done by adding a link to
   the libsz.* files in the /usr/lib folder or by adding the library
   location to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
      Ex. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path_to_szip_lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   Optionally, one can use the static szip library files by adding '-static'
   to the CFLAGS environment variable.
   
o  Existing data written by an HDF4 Library prior to HDF 4.2r2:
   When a one-dimensional SDS and a dimension scale have
   the same name, subsequent accesses to the dimension scale or to the
   SDS might produce undesired results because the libraries could not
   distinguish between the two objects.  In the case of writing, data
   might even be corrupted.  For example, SDS data might be written to a
   dimension variable or vice versa. (bugzilla #624)

   HDF4 Library Releases 4.2r2 and later make a distinction between an SDS
   and a dimension variable.  However, as with older versions, these recent
   versions are unable to detect such conflicts in files created by earlier 
   releases.  It is therefore STRONGLY recommended to check for such name 
   duplication before working with data created with a pre-4.2r2 library.

   The functions SDgetnumvars_byname and SDnametoindices are provided
   to help detect such name conflicts and select the correct object to
   access, respectively; see the HDF Reference Manual entries for
   further details.
   FB - 2009/01/26
   BMR - revised 2011/06/24

o  N-bit compression is not supported with Fortran APIs.

o  Using both fill-value and compression on SD datasets does not work.

o  When using PGI compilers, make sure that the JPEG library is also compiled 
   with a PGI C compiler; linking with a JPEG library built with gcc causes 
   JPEG library tests to fail.  To bypass the problem:

       x Set LIBS flag to $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a
         where $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR points to the installation directory
         for the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         setenv LIBS $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a

       x Use the --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR configure flag to 
         configure with the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         ./configure --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR --with-zlib....

o  In order for the API SDgetdatasize to get the correct compressed size
   of the data, the dataset needs to be closed (SDendaccess) or read
   (SDreaddata) after being written and before SDgetdatasize is called.

New features and changes
========================
   Configuration
   ============= 
   - The macro H4_NO_DEPRECATED_SYMBOLS was added to handle deprecated
     functions/features.  To use deprecated functions/features, the library
     must be configured with option HDF4_ENABLE_DEPRECATED_SYMBOLS.
     (ADB, BMR 2013/1/25)
     

Support for new platforms and compilers
=======================================
   - Ported to Mac OSX 10.8 (Mountain Lion) with Clang as the default C
     compiler. (AKC 2013/1/19)

   - Ported to Mac OSX 10.8 (Mountain Lion) with Intel compilers.
               (EIP 2013/02/05)

Bugs fixed since HDF 4.2.8
=========================
   Configuration
   =============
   - Cygwin >= 1.7.7; The SunRPC of the glibc has been replaced by a TI-RPC 
     (Transport Independent RPC) library to support IPv6. Configure has been 
     updated to look for the tirpc library instead of rpc. (ADB 2012/11/09)

   Library
   ========= 
   - SDgetcompress is now deprecated and not available by default.  Its
     availability can be activated using option HDF4_ENABLE_DEPRECATED_SYMBOLS.
     (BMR 2012/1/25)
   - Some memory leaks were fixed. (BMR 2012/10/01)

   Utilities
   ========= 
   - Vnattrs/Vattrinfo/Vgetattr are replaced with Vnattrs2/Vattrinfo2/Vgetattr2
     in various tools to ensure attributes that are not created by Vsetattr
     can still be detected and accessed.  The Reference Manual and User's Guide
     provide details about this issue. (BMR 2012/12/25)


Documentation
=============
   - The Reference Manual and User's Guide have minor updates.
   - The Specification and Developer's Guide is extensively updated.

Known problems
==============
o  On SunOS 5.11, the -xc99 flag has to be used with the cc compiler to avoid
   compilation errors.  Future releases will automatically detect the system and
   add the flag. (HDFFR-1361) EIP - 2013/02/05

o  For Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and on 10.8 Mountain Lion, several tests fail with
   GCC, Intel and Clang compilers.  Currently, this situation is detected and
   -O0 level optimization is used.  We will work on the issue for the next
   release. (HDFFR-1358,1327,1358) EIP - 2013/02/05

o  On IBM PowerPC 64, hdftest fails when gcc 4.4.6 is used with -O3 optimization 
   level. 

o  When building in AIX systems, if CC is xlc with -qlanglvl=ansi, configure
   will fail when checking for the jpeglib.h header due to the duplicated
   macro definition of HAVE_STDLIB_H.  This is because some newer builds
   of the jpeg library have HAVE_STDLIB_H defined in the jconfig.h header file.
   Without the -qlanglvl=ansi, some older xlc versions (e.g., V7.0) still 
   fail, but newer xlc versions (e.g., V9.0) pass.  AKC - 2010/02/17

o  When building on Linux/UNIX platforms, the szip shared library files must
   be in the system library path.  This can be done by adding a link to
   the libsz.* files in the /usr/lib folder or by adding the library
   location to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
      Ex. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path_to_szip_lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   Optionally, one can use the static szip library files by adding '-static'
   to the CFLAGS environment variable.
   
o  Existing data written by an HDF4 Library prior to HDF 4.2r2:
   When a one-dimensional SDS and a dimension scale have
   the same name, subsequent accesses to the dimension scale or to the
   SDS might produce undesired results because the libraries could not
   distinguish between the two objects.  In the case of writing, data
   might even be corrupted.  For example, SDS data might be written to a
   dimension variable or vice versa.

   HDF4 Library Releases 4.2r2 and later make a distinction between an SDS
   and a dimension variable.  However, as with older versions, these recent
   versions are unable to detect such conflicts in files created by earlier 
   releases.  It is therefore STRONGLY recommended to check for such name 
   duplication before working with data created with a pre-4.2r2 library.

   The functions SDgetnumvars_byname and SDnametoindices are provided
   to help detect such name conflicts and select the correct object to
   access, respectively; see the HDF Reference Manual entries for
   further details.

o  This release does not support VMS systems.

o  N-bit compression is not supported with Fortran APIs.

o  Using both fill-value and compression on SD datasets does not work.

o  When using PGI compilers, make sure that the JPEG library is also compiled 
   with a PGI C compiler; linking with a JPEG library built with gcc causes 
   JPEG library tests to fail.  To bypass the problem:

       x Set LIBS flag to $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a
         where $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR points to the installation directory
         for the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         setenv LIBS $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a

       x Use the --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR configure flag to 
         configure with the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         ./configure --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR --with-zlib....

o  In order for the API SDgetdatasize to get the correct compressed size
   of the data, the dataset needs to be closed (SDendaccess) or read
   (SDreaddata) after being written and before SDgetdatasize is called.

New features and changes
========================
   Source distribution
   ===================
   - [None.  PPM - YYYY/MM/DD]

   Configuration
   ============= 
   - [None]
     
   Library
   ========= 
   - It was discovered by the HDF Mapping Project that there were certain
     type of palettes that cannot be retrieved by existing functions.  A new
     function, GRgetpalinfo, was added to allow applications to get information
     about palettes.  Please refer to the HDF User's Guide and Reference Manual
     for more information regarding this palette issue.  BMR - 2012/07/26

   - It was also discovered that the IMCOMP compression was not detected.
     Although IMCOMP is no longer supported in new data, HDF still needs to
     detect IMCOMP compression from existing data.  We added COMP_CODE_IMCOMP
     to comp_coder_t with value 12 (same as COMP_IMCOMP.)  The library and
     hdp now can detect IMCOMP compression.  However, writing IMCOMP compressed
     images is not allowed.  BMR - 2012/07/26

   - Added GRgetcomptype to return image's compression, which can include
     IMCOMP.  BMR - 2012/07/26

   Test

Support for new platforms and compilers
=======================================
   -  Mac OS X 10.7.4 with GNU gcc and gfortran compilers


Bugs fixed since HDF 4.2.7
=========================
   Configuration
   =============
   - Add config/apple-darwin11.4.0 customized for Mac OS X 10.7 Lion. This one
     set production CFLAGS to -O0 to eliminate the test errors encountered in
     Lion systems only. This one lets HDF4 to be build and run in Lion systems.
     More investigate needed to locate the exact locations of the errors.
     (HDFFR-1327 and HDFFR-1328) AKC - 2012/07/03

   - The USE_ENUM in mfhdf/libsrc/netcdf.h, which is copied from
     config/netcdf-apple.h, which generated an error due to xdr_enum overwrote
     memory outside of its designated enum variable. This happened only to the
     apple provided compiler (i686-apple-darwin11-llvm-gcc-4.2 (GCC) 4.2.1).
     We decided to not define USE_ENUM for all apple OS for now. (HDFFR-1318)
     AKC - 2012/07/01

   Library
   ========= 
   - [None]

   Utilities
   ========= 
   - Added test file IMCOMP.hdf and sample file dumpgr-20.out for IMCOMP test
     for testing the detection of IMCOMP compressed image in hdp.
     BMR - 2012/07/26


Documentation
==============
   - The Reference Manual and User's Guide have been updated to include
     new functions:
     + GRgetpalinfo
     + GRgetcomptype

Known problems
==============

o  For Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, the test suite on the mfhdf side encounter 2 erros,
   when optimization is used, whether with the Apple GCC compiler or with the
   GNU GCC compiler.  CFLAGS must be set to use no optimization (-O0 or -g) to
   avoid these failures.  config/apple-darwin11.4.0 is added to direct configure
   to use -O0 for CFLAGS for Mac OS X 10.7 Lion. We hope to fix the bug in the
   next release.  (HDFFR-1327 and HDFFR-1328) AKC - 2012/07/03

o  On IBM PowerPC 64 hdftest fails when gcc 4.4.6 is used with -O3 optimization level. 

o  When building in AIX systems, if CC is xlc with -qlanglvl=ansi, configure
   will fail when checking for the jpeglib.h header due to the duplicated
   macro definition of HAVE_STDLIB_H.  This is because some newer builds
   of jpeg library have HAVE_STDLIB_H defined in the jconfig.h header file.
   Without the -qlanglvl=ansi, some older xlc (e.g., V7.0) still fails but
   newer xlc (e.g., V9.0) passes.  AKC - 2010/02/17

o  When building on Linux/UNIX platforms, the szip shared library files must
   be in the system library path. This can be done by adding a link to
   the libsz.* files in the /usr/lib folder or by adding the library

         configure with the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         ./configure --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR --with-zlib....

New features and changes
========================
   Source distribution
   ===================
   - None


   Configuration
   ============= 
   - Fortran fort_ps folders are now obsolete, and VS2008 project
     files have been updated.
     CMake was tested on Windows, Linux, and Cygwin.
     ADB - 2012/1/20
     
   Library
   =========

     "length" for external data length.  (part 1 in bug HDFFR-1297)
     BMR - 2012/1/15
   - Visinternal is superseded by Vgisinternal, which allows the handling of
     special cases in old data.  (part 2 in bug HDFFR-1297)
     BMR - 2012/1/15
   - Fortran wrappers vfgvgroups and vsfgvdatas have been added for 
     Vgetvgroups and VSgetvdatas, respectively.
     MSB - 2012/1/5

Bugs fixed since HDF4.2.6
=========================
   Utilities
   ========= 
   - hrepack: Version HDF4 2.6 does not allow the combination of unlimited 
     dimensions and compression, which is wrong. 
   - Freeing incorrect buffers caused segfault.  It was previously commented
     out, thus resulted in memory leaks.  This is now fixed.  (HDFFR-479)
     BMR - 2011/11/3
   - hdp: fixed to skip netCDF files when checking for compression.  (HDFFR-473)
     BMR - 2011/11/1


   Library
   ========= 
   - SDgetchunkinfo and SDreadchunk failed on an empty SDS when the file is
     opened as read-only (HDFFR-171).  This is now fixed.
     BMR - 2011/10/20
   - SDcheckempty was fixed to return "empty" when detecting a pair of
     DFTAG_SD/<valid ref> that is associated with offset=INVALID_OFFSET and
     length=INVALID_LENGTH.
     BMR - 2011/10/9
   - Vgetclass and Vgetname were fixed to return vgclass and vgname with null
     terminated character when the class or name is not set. (HDFFR-1288)
     BMR - 2011/9/19

Known problems
==============

o  On IBM PowerPC 64 hdftest fails when gcc 4.4.6 is used with -O3 optimization level. 

o  When building in AIX systems, if CC is xlc with -qlanglvl=ansi, configure
   fails when checking for the jpeglib.h header due to the duplicated
   macro definition of HAVE_STDLIB_H.  This is because some newer builds
   of jpeg library have HAVE_STDLIB_H defined in the jconfig.h header file.
   Without the -qlanglvl=ansi, some older xlc (e.g., V7.0) still fails but
   newer xlc (e.g., V9.0) passes.  AKC - 2010/02/17

o  When building on Linux/UNIX platforms, the szip shared library files must
   be in the system library path. This can be done by adding a link to
   the libsz.* files in the /usr/lib folder or by adding the library
   location to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
      Ex. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path_to_szip_lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   Optionally, one can use the static szip library files by adding '-static'
   to the CFLAGS environment variable.
   
o  Existing data written by an HDF4 Library prior to HDF 4.2r2:
   When a one-dimensional SDS and a dimension scale have
   the same name, subsequent accesses to the dimension scale or to the
   SDS might produce undesired results because the libraries could not
   distinguish between the two objects.  In the case of writing, data
   might even be corrupted.  For example, SDS data might be written to a
   dimension variable or vice versa.

   HDF4 Library Releases 4.2r2 and later make a distinction between an SDS
   and a dimension variable.  However, as with older versions, these recent
   versions are unable to detect such conflicts in files created by earlier 
   releases.  It is therefore STRONGLY recommended to check for such name 
   duplication before working with data created with a pre-4.2r2 library.

   The functions SDgetnumvars_byname and SDnametoindices are provided
   to help detect such name conflicts and select the correct object to
   access, respectively; see the HDF Reference Manual entries for
   further details.

o  This release does not support VMS systems.

o  N-bit compression is not supported with Fortran APIs.

o  Using both fill-value and compression on SD datasets does not work.

o  When using PGI compilers, make sure that the JPEG library is also compiled 
   with a PGI C compiler; linking with a JPEG library built with gcc causes 
   JPEG library tests to fail.  To bypass the problem:

       x Set LIBS flag to $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a
         where $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR points to the installation directory
         for the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         setenv LIBS $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a

       x Use the --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR configure flag to 
         configure with the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         ./configure --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR --with-zlib....

o  In order for the API SDgetdatasize to get the correct compressed size
   of the data, the dataset needs to be closed (SDendaccess) or read
   (SDreaddata) after being written and before SDgetdatasize is called.

INTRODUCTION

This document describes the differences between HDF 4.2.5 and HDF 4.2.6.
It is written for people who are familiar with previous releases of HDF 
and wish to migrate to HDF 4.2.6.

The HDF 4.2.6 documentation can be found on the The HDF Group's FTP server:

    ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF/Documentation/

First-time HDF users are encouraged to read the HDF FAQ, which can be
reached from the HDF product home page:

New features and changes
========================
   Source distribution
   ===================
   - [None]

   Configuration
   ============= 
   - CMake support has been added. Current version recommemded is CMake 2.8.4.
     ADB - 2011/06/14

   - Specified explicit version of the netCDF API (v 2.3.2) used by HDF in
     configure help and in configuration SUMMARY.
     
   Library
   ========= 
   - Prior to HDF version 4.2.6, passing 0 for count caused failure; however,
     the failure did not occur in SDsetattr but was delayed until SDend.  This
     can potentially cause file corruption.  Starting from release 4.2.6,
     SDsetattr will fail when count is 0. BMR - 2011/06/09

   - The function Vnattrs only processes attributes created by Vsetattr.  It is
     not aware of attributes created by the pre-Vsetattr methods.  The following
     functions are added to work around the limitation of Vnattrs:
     + Vnattrs2 gives number of new- and old-style attributes
     + Vattrinfo2 gives information about an old or new style attribute
     + Vgetattr2 reads values of an old or new style attribute
     BMR - 2011/06/09

   - The following functions were added to support the HDF4 Mapping
     project specifically:
     + VSgetdatainfo gives offsets/lengths of a vdata's data
     + ANgetdatainfo gives offset/length of an annotation's data
     + SDgetdatainfo gives offsets/lengths of a data set's data
     + GRgetdatainfo gives offsets/lengths of a raster image's data
     + VSgetattdatainfo gives offset/length of vdata attribute's data
     + VGgetattdatainfo gives offset/length of vgroup attribute's data
     + GRgetattdatainfo gives offset/length of raster image attribute's data
     + SDgetattdatainfo gives offset/length of data set attribute's data
     + SDgetoldattdatainfo gives offset/length of a pre-defined attribute in
       old format
     + SDgetanndatainfo gives offset/lenth of an annotation belonging to an SDS
     + Vgetvgroups gives a list of user-created vgroups
     + VSgetvdatas gives a list of user-created vdatas
     + VSofclass gives a list of vdatas of a specific class
     + Hgetntinfo gives some information about a number type
     + GR2bmapped indicates whether a raster image should be mapped
     BMR - 2011/06/09

   - Two functions are added to provide information of an external file:
     VSgetexternalfile for a vdata and SDgetexternalfile for a data set.
     BMR - 2011/06/09


   Utilities

Support for new platforms and compilers
=======================================
   - [None]

Bugs fixed since HDF4.2.5
=========================
   Utilities
   ========= 
   - hdp dumpvd and dumpsds now provide the name of the external file in the
     error message when reading fails due to missing the external file.
     BMR - 2011/06/10
   - The problem where hdiff displays zeroes for Vdata values that are non-zero
     had been fixed.  BMR - 2011/06/09
   - hdp had been fixed for the problems of
     + dumpvd printing Name/Class incorrectly
     + dumprig giving wrong info about RIS24 and palettes
     + dumpvg missing some items in the Graphical representation
     BMR - 2011/06/09


   Library
   ========= 
   - The JPEG test failure due to the different versions of the JPEG library
     had been fixed.  HDF4 is expected to build and pass regression tests for
     any version of the JPEG library available on the user's systems. 
     BMR - 2011/06/09


   Configuration

Known problems
==============

o  Wnen buidling in AIX systems, if CC is xlc with -qlanglvl=ansi, configure
   fails when checking for the jpeglib.h header due to the duplicated
   macro definition of HAVE_STDLIB_H.  This is because some newer builds
   of jpeg library has HAVE_STDLIB_H defined in its jconfig.h header file.
   Without the -qlanglvl=ansi, some older xlc (e.g., V7.0) still fails but
   newer xlc (e.g., V9.0) passes.  AKC - 2010/02/17

o  When building on Linux/UNIX platforms, the szip shared library files must
   be in the system library path. This can be done by adding a link to
   the libsz.* files into the /usr/lib folder or by adding the library
   location to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
      Ex. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path_to_szip_lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   Optionally, one can use the static szip library files by adding '-static'
   to the CFLAGS environment variable.
   
o  Existing data written by an HDF4 Library prior to HDF 4.2r2:
   When a one-dimensional SDS and a dimension scale were created with
   the same name, subsequent accesses to the dimension scale or to the
   SDS might corrupt the data.

   HDF4 Library Releases 4.2r2 and later do not allow this conflict to
   occur.  On the other hand, recent libraries are also unable to detect
   such conflicts that already exist in a file.  It is therefore STRONGLY
   recommended to check for such name duplication before working with data 
   created with a pre-4.2r2 library. 

   The functions SDgetnumvars_byname and SDnametoindices are provided
   to help detect such name conflicts and select the correct object to
   access, respectively; see the HDF Reference Manual entries for 
   further details.

o  This release does not support VMS systems.

o  N-Bit compression is not supported with Fortran APIs.

o  Using both fill-value and compression on SD datasets does not work.

o  When using PGI compilers, make sure that the JPEG library is also compiled 
   with a PGI C compiler; linking with a JPEG library built with gcc causes 
   JPEG library tests to fail.  To bypass the problem:

       x Set LIBS flag to $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a
         where $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR points to the installation directory
         for the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         setenv LIBS $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a

       x Use the --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR configure flag to 
         configure with the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         ./configure --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR --with-zlib....

o  In order for the API SDgetdatasize to get the correct compressed size
   of the data, the dataset needs to be closed (SDendaccess) or read
   (SDreaddata), after being written and before SDgetdatasize is called.

New features and changes
========================
    Source distribution
    ===================
    - For the complete list of the removed obsolete files see Appendix.
    - Removed obsolete mfhdf/port and mfhdf/c++ directories and related 
      code
        (EIP - 2010/1/18)
    - Removed obsolete hdf/fmpool directory and related code
    - Removed obsolete constants PCIO, WINIO, PAGEBIFIO, and WINNTIO from
      hdfi.h and hfile.h 
        (EIP - 2009/12/31)
    - INSTALL* files were moved to the release_notes directory
        (EIP - 2009/12/29)
    - SD tests were moved from mfhdf/libsrc to mfhdf/test.
	  (BMR - 2009/09/10)

    Configuration
    ============= 
    - Added a configure check that will fail when jpeg version 7 is
      used, as this is not yet supported in HDF4. (MAM - 2010/01/28)
    - Configure suite now built with the following versions of the autotools:
        Automake 1.11.1, Autoconf 2.65, and Libtool 2.2.6b  
        (MAM - 2009/12/14)

    Library
    ========= 
    - SDgetchunkinfo now contains compression type and compression
      information.  If failure occurs while getting compression information,
      the associate compression parameters will be set to -1 to indicate
      that no compression information is retrieved, instead of SDgetchunkinfo
      simply fails.  This is to support backward compatibily.
      (BMR - 2010/02/04)
    - Vgroup name and class name can now be more than the previous limit
      of 64 characters.  Two public functions are provided for applications
      to be able to allocate sufficient space for these items.
        int32 Vgetnamelen (int32 vkey, uint16 *name_len);
        int32 Vgetclassnamelen (int32 vkey, uint16 *classname_len);
      Please refer to the Reference Manual and User's Guide for details.
      (BMR - 2010/01/27)
    - SDreset_maxopenfiles allows users to reset the number of the files that 
      can be open at the same time to the system limit minus 3. On AIX 6.1
      system limit is 2GB-1 causing HDF4 to choke. Source code was modified 
      to put a cap on the system limit to not exceed 
      H4_MAX_AVAIL_OPENFILES (currently 20000).  (EIP - 2010/02/01) 
    - "make installcheck" builds and tests examples using h4cc and h4fc
      scripts (MAM, BMR and MSB - 2009/12)
    - HDF Fortran examples were added to hdf/fortran/examples. 
      (MAM - 2009/12/14)
    - SD examples were added to mfhdf/examples.  (BMR - 2009/08/28)
    - HDF C examples were added to hdf/examples.  (BMR - 2009/11/07)

    Test
    ====
    - Added tests for GRfindattr, GRattrinfo, and GRgetattr (BMR - 2009/11/15)
    - Moved SD tests out of mfhdf/libsrc into the new directory mfhdf/test
      (BMR - 2009/09/10)

    Utilities
    ========= 
    - Added flag -k to hdp dumpsds to keep the order of the outputted
      SDSs the same as the order they were specified on the command
      line.  The default (without -k) is SDSs are printed in the order
      in which they were added to the file (ie., indices.) (BMR - 2010/02/03)
    - Added -V flag to hdiff, hrepack, hdfimport, ncdump and ncgen; 
      when specified, tool prints library version string and exits.
          (EIP - 2010/01/28) 
    - Hrepack: set default value for JPEG's quality factor to 75 to
      prevent image distortion when the factor is not provided by user
      (BMR - 2010/01/14)
 
    Daily Test and Release
    ======================
    Added h4vers and release scripts and Snapshot Release capability.

Support for new platforms and compilers
=======================================
   Added support for 64-bit Mac Intel with gcc, gfortran and Intel C
   and Fortran compilers.
   Added support for AIX 6.1 using IBM XL C and Fortran compilers.
   (EIP - 2010/1/29)

Bugs fixed since HDF4.2.4
=========================
    Utilities
    ========= 
        - None 

    Library
    ========= 
    - The problem where incorrect result occurred when attempting
      to retrieve the dimension scale's number type from a netCDF file
      was fixed (bugzilla #1644.) (BMR - 2009/09/25)
    - The problem where pieces of an image get written multiple times
      at different locations in the 2-D array had been fixed.  The
      cause was the pointer to user's buffer was not advanced properly.
      This was part of bugzilla 1547.  (BMR - 2009/06/10)
    - The problem which SDgetdimstrs failed if there are no attributes
      attached to the dimension had been fixed.  SDgetdimstrs now returns
      the attribute strings containing '\0' for the first character, as
      specified in the documentation. (BMR - 2009/08/28)


    Configuration
    =============
    - The mfhdf/ncgen/Makefile.in now has $(EXEEXT) appended to the ncgen
      program whenever it is referenced in a build rule dependency. This 
      fixes some compile problems on Cygwin, where the .exe is necessary.
      (MAM - 2009/12/17). 
    - Configure will now fail if the yacc or flex utilities are not available
      (as opposed to failing sometime during make when they are used).
      (MAM - 2009/12/17).
    - Configure will now properly check for the rpc library when on
      Cygwin, and fail gracefully if it is not found. (MAM - 2009/12/17)
    - Configure will no longer try to use a Fortran compiler to set up
      aspects of the build environment when Fortran has been disabled, as
      configure now deliberately sets the F77 environment variable to 'no'
      when Fortran is disabled. This should no longer cause build problems 
      on Cygwin when no Fortran compiler is available. (MAM - 2009/12/14)
    - './configure --help' will now correctly indicate that shared libraries
      are disabled by default. (MAM - 2009/12/14)

Known problems
==============

o  Wnen buidling in AIX systems, if CC is xlc with -qlanglvl=ansi, configure
   fails when checking for the jpeglib.h header due to the duplicated
   macro definition of HAVE_STDLIB_H.  This is because some newer builds
   of jpeg library has HAVE_STDLIB_H defined in its jconfig.h header file.
   Without the -qlanglvl=ansi, some older xlc (e.g., V7.0) still fails but
   newer xlc (e.g., V9.0) passes. (AKC - 2010/02/17)

o  When building on Linux/UNIX platforms, the szip shared library files must
   be in the system library path. This can be done by adding a link to
   the libsz.* files into the /usr/lib folder or by adding the library
   location to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
      Ex. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path_to_szip_lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   Optionally, one can use the static szip library files by adding '-static'
   to the CFLAGS environment variable.
   
o  Existing data written by an HDF4 Library prior to HDF 4.2r2:
   When a one-dimensional SDS and a dimension scale were created with
   the same name, subsequent accesses to the dimension scale or to the
   SDS might corrupt the data.

   HDF4 Library Releases 4.2r2 and later do not allow this conflict to
   occur.  On the other hand, recent libraries are also unable to detect
   such conflicts that already exist in a file.  It is therefore STRONGLY
   recommended to check for such name duplication before working with data 
   created with a pre-4.2r2 library. 

   The functions SDgetnumvars_byname and SDnametoindices are provided
   to help detect such name conflicts and select the correct object to
   access, respectively; see the HDF Reference Manual entries for 
   further details.

o  This release does not support VMS systems.

o  N-Bit compression is not supported with Fortran APIs.

o  Using both fill-value and compression on SD datasets does not work.

o  When using PGI compilers, make sure that the JPEG library is also compiled 
   with a PGI C compiler; linking with a JPEG library built with gcc causes 
   JPEG library tests to fail.  To bypass the problem:

       x Set LIBS flag to $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a
         where $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR points to the installation directory
         for the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         setenv LIBS $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a

       x Use the --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR configure flag to 
         configure with the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         ./configure --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR --with-zlib....

o  In order for the API SDgetdatasize to get the correct compressed size
   of the data, the dataset needs to be closed (SDendaccess) or read
   (SDreaddata), after being written and before SDgetdatasize is called.

                          HDF 4.2 Release 4  
                          =================
                          January 25, 2009

INTRODUCTION

This document describes the differences between HDF 4.2r3 and HDF 4.2r4
It is written for people who are familiar with previous releases of HDF 
and wish to migrate to HDF 4.2r4

The HDF 4.2r4 documentation can be found on the The HDF Group's FTP server:

     ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF/Documentation/

First-time HDF users are encouraged to read the HDF FAQ, which can be
reached from the HDF product home page:
  
     http://hdfgroup.org/products/hdf4/

If you have any questions or comments, please see the HDF Support page:

     http://hdfgroup.org/services/support.html

New features and changes
========================
    Configuration
    ============= 
        - Automake 1.10.1 used to generate Makefile.in files, and 
          Autoconf 2.61 used to generate configure script. MAM - 2008/10/09
        - Libtool support (2.2.6a) has been added, and HDF4 shared C 
          libraries can now be built. To build, use the --enable-shared 
          configuration flag. This needs to be used in conjunction with 
          the --disable-fortran flag, as Fortran shared libraries are not 
          supported. Shared libraries are disabled by default. 
          MAM - 2008/10/09
        - Added SZIP information to end of configure summary, which indicates
          whether SZIP is present and, if SZIP is present, whether the SZIP
          encoder is present.  MAM - 2008/10/06

    Library
    ========= 
        - Added new API SDgetdatasize to retrieve the compressed and original
          sizes of an SDS' data.  Its limitation is listed in the "Known 
          problems" section at the end of this document.
          intn SDgetdatasize(int32 sdsid, int32* comp_size, int32* orig_size)
                sdsid     - IN: dataset ID
                comp_size - OUT: size of compressed data
                orig_size - OUT: size of original data 
          BMR - 2008/10/15

        - The following Fortran APIs were added in this release:
                sfgetname
                sfgetnamelen
                sfgmaxopenf
                sfgnumopenf
                sfrmaxopenf
                sfidtype
                sfgnvars_byname
                sfn2indices
          Please see HDF Reference Manual for functions description.
          Note: These APIs are not available on Windows.

    Utilities
    ========= 
        - hrepack output now includes dataset compression ratios.
          PVN - 2008/10/30
        - hdp now displays various parameters of Gzip, Szip, and Skipping
          Huffman compressions when a dataset is compressed. (Bugzilla 1202)
          BMR - 2008/10/03


Support for new platforms and compilers
=======================================
        Linux 2.6.27 x86_64 Fedora 10 with GNU C and gfortran
                            Ubuntu 8.10 with GNU C and gfortran
                            OpenSuse 11.1 with GNU C and gfortran

        Mac Intel with GNU C, gfortran, g95 and Intel 10.1 32-bit 
        C and Fortran compilers

          Note: Only the 32-bit version of the Intel compiler is supported. 

          One has to run configuration scripts, which can be found under 
          the bin directories in the Intel compiler installation directory 
          tree (e.g., /opt/intel/cc/10.1.006/bin/iccvars.csh and 
          /opt/intel/fc/10.1.006/bin/ifortvars.csh), to enable the
          32-bit version of the compiler before configuring and building HDF4.

          Known problems: 
          Due to a known bug in the Intel 10.1 icc compiler, one has to use
          -no-multibyte-chars flag with icc. O0 flag with ifort is required
          to build Fortran APIs and tests. This restriction is probably due
          to very old Fortran code and will be lifted for future releases.  
        

Bugs fixed since HDF4.2r3
=========================
    Utilities
    ========= 
        - hrepack previously failed to preserve unlimited dataset dimensions; 
          they are now preserved.  PVN - 2008/11/19

    Library
    ========= 
        - SDreaddata now checks for out-of-range values in the parameter 
          'stride' and fails when invalid values are given (Bugzilla 150.)  
          This bug was actually fixed right before the HDF4.2r2 release.  
          BMR - 2008/07/14
        - Reading a record variable using nc API fills the buffer with fill
          values up to the maximum number of records of all unlimited
          dimension variables in the file, as in netCDF.  It used to fail
          before (Bugzilla 1378.) - BMR 2009/01/21
        - When the file name is too long, some SD APIs caused a segmentation 
          fault (Bugzilla 1331.)  This problem is now fixed. - BMR 2009/01/23

    Configuration
    ============= 
        - hdiff_array.c now gets linked against libm.a library. 

Documentation
==============
The updated HDF Reference Manual is now available in HTML format.

Known problems
==============

o  Existing data written by an HDF4 Library prior to HDF 4.2r2:
   When a one-dimensional SDS and a dimension scale were created with
   the same name, subsequent accesses to the dimension scale or to the
   SDS might corrupt the data.

   HDF4 Library Releases 4.2r2 and later do not allow this conflict to
   occur.  On the other hand, recent libraries are also unable to detect
   such conflicts that already exist in a file.  It is therefore STRONGLY
   recommended to check for such name duplication before working with data 
   created with a pre-4.2r2 library. 

   The functions SDgetnumvars_byname and SDnametoindices are provided
   to help detect such name conflicts and select the correct object to
   access, respectively; see the HDF Reference Manual entries for 
   further details.

o  This release does not support VMS systems.

o  N-Bit compression is not supported with Fortran APIs.

o  Using both fill-value and compression on SD datasets does not work.

o  When using PGI compilers, make sure that the JPEG library is also compiled 
   with a PGI C compiler; linking with a JPEG library built with gcc causes 
   JPEG library tests to fail.  To bypass the problem:

       x Set LIBS flag to $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a
         where $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR points to the installation directory
         for the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         setenv LIBS $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a

       x Use the --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR configure flag to 
         configure with the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         ./configure --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR --with-zlib....

o  In order for the new API SDgetdatasize to get the correct compressed size
   of the data, the dataset needs to be closed (SDendaccess) or read
   (SDreaddata), after being written and before SDgetdatasize is called.

o  On a fedora x86_64 GNU/Linux machine with gfortran 4.3.2, the flag
   -fno-range-check needs to be used to work around old code.
   
o  On Windows with Visual Studio .NET 2003, a minor bug in the hdfnctest test
    causes it to fail.  The failure is non-critical, and so the test has been
    disabled by default for all Windows compilers.

New features and changes
========================
    Configuration
    ============= 
    None 

    Library
    ========= 

	- Modified the HDF4 mfhdf library and configure to work in the 
	  absence of the NetCDF-3 header files when the HDF4 library 
	  is configured with the --disable-netcdf flag. This feature is 
	  required when building the ESDIS Toolkit in the presence of the
	  NetCDF-3 library. In this case, the HDF4 file netcdf.h is used 
	  to build the HDF4 libraries and is installed under the name 
	  "hdf4_netcdf.h" to avoid a name clash with the NetCDF-3 file 
	  netcdf.h.
							EIP 2007-10-30

	- Note that the previous change to SDnametoindex was backed out.  It 
	  only returns the first variable of the requested name, as did the 
	  original version of this function.  The variable can be an SDS or 
	  a coordinate variable.  With this behavior, if there is more than
	  one variable with the same name in the file, care must be taken to
	  retrieve the desired variable.  Please see new APIs in the next 
	  item for a way to handle non-uniquely named variables.  The behavior 
	  of SDnametoindex will be documented in FAQs, documentation, and the
	  newsletter.
							BMR 2008-01-17

	- Added new APIs to SD interface:
	  + SDgetnumvars_byname: Given a name, returns the number of 
	    variables in a file with that same name.
	  + SDnametoindices: Given a name, returns a list of indices of 
	    all the variables in a file with that same name.
	  With these new APIs, users can determine when an SDS name or 
	  a coordinate variable's name is not unique, retrieve the named 
	  variables, and examine them.

    Utilities
    ========= 
        None 


Support for new platforms and compilers
=======================================
        
    Support for Windows XP 64-bit with Visual Studio 2005 and 
    Intel Fortran compiler was added. 

Bugs fixed since HDF4.2r2
=========================
    Utilities
    ========= 
        None

    Library
    ========= 
        None

    Configuration
    ============= 
       - libhdf4.settings file was not installed by make install command;
         fixed

New features and changes
========================
    Configuration
    ============= 
        - The default installation directory name was changed from "NewHDF" 
          to "hdf4".                            EIP - 2007/08/06
        - Introduced --enable-netcdf configure flag to provide an option to
          enable/disable "HDF4-NetCDF"-like interfaces. By default, the 
          HDF4 netcdf feature is enabled.  Use the --disable-netcdf 
          configuration flag to build HDF4 C and Fortran libraries that can 
          be used by NetCDF-3 applications. There is no longer a need to 
          specify the -DHAVE_NETCDF compilation flag.  This feature is not 
          yet supported on Windows.             EIP - 2007/09/05
        - Updated versions of autotools. HDF4 now uses automake 1.10.0,
          autoconf 2.61, and libtool 1.5.22.    MAM - 2007/7/25.
        - The Fortran part of the HDF4 library uses the F77_FUNC macro to 
          mangle names of C functions called from Fortran APIs. This should 
          help with HDF4 code portability to different Fortran compilers.
                                                EIP - 2006/12/19
     
    Library
    ========= 
        - SZIP compression is supported now for GR C interfaces
                                                EIP - 2007/09/15
        - Added new Fortran function hconfinf that determines whether the 
          SZIP compression method is present and whether encoding is available.
        - Added support for SZIP compression in Fortran.
                                                EIP - 2007/09/01
        - The following APIs were added; see "Bugs fixed" section for details.
          SDreset_maxopenfiles -- Resets the maximum number of files that can 
                  be open at a time.
          SDget_maxopenfiles -- Retrieves the current number of open files
                  allowed in HDF and the maximum number of open files allowed 
                  on a system.
          SDget_numopenfiles -- Returns the number of files currently open.
          SDgetcompinfo -- Replaces SDgetcompress.
          GRgetcompinfo -- Replaces GRgetcompress.
          SDgetfilename -- Retrieves the name of the file, given its ID.
          SDgetnamelen -- Retrieves the name length of the object, given its ID.
          Note: Fortran wrappers for these new APIs are not available in this 
          release.  BMR - 2007/09/23
        - SDS and vgroup names are no longer limited to 64 characters
          (Bugzilla #516).  Note that when an older version of the library 
          reads a new name that is longer than 64 characters, the name will
          contain some garbage after 64 characters.  BMR - 2006/10/12
        - User reported that SDreaddata went into an infinite loop when 
          reading some corrupted compressed data.  This problem is fixed.
          Two new error codes were added, consequently:
                DFE_READCOMP  - when the zlib function returns
                        Z_ERRNO        (-1) or
                        Z_STREAM_ERROR (-2) or
                        Z_DATA_ERROR   (-3) or
                        Z_MEM_ERROR    (-4) or
                        Z_BUF_ERROR    (-5)

                DFE_COMPVERSION - when the zlib function returns
                        Z_VERSION_ERROR (-6)


    Utilities
    ========= 
        - hrepack repacks by hyperslabs for large (non-compressed) datasets.
                                                         PVN - 2007/7/10
        - hdiff enables reading by hyperslabs. This feature was added to 
          handle very large datasets, where available memory is a isssue. 
                                                         PVN - 2007/6/13
        - hdiff now shows indices in multidimensional array notation. 
                                                         PVN - 2007/4/5
        - hdiff now shows the name of the array when printing differences. 
                                                         PVN - 2007/4/5
        - hdiff now shows a list of all objects in verbose mode. 
                                                         PVN - 2007/4/5
        - hdiff return code is now 1 if differences are found, 0 if no
          differences are found, and -1 for an error.    PVN - 2007/4/5
        - hdiff has a new option, -p, for relative error. See usage. 
                                                         PVN - 2007/4/5
        - hrepack now prints chunk information along with the compression 
          type in verbose mode.                          PVN - 2007/4/5

                                        EIP 2006/12/19

Bugs fixed since HDF4.2r1
=========================
     Utilities
    ========= 
        - hrepack: Repeated vgroup insertions (duplicated links) were not being 
          replicated.  PVN - 2007/9/10
        - hrepack: Improved performance for large number of SDSs, through the 
          elimination of redundant file open calls.  PVN - 2007/4/5
        - hrepack: Fixed a bug in the -t option so that it now accepts multiple
          comma-separated names.  PVN - 2007/4/5
        - hrepack: Now duplicates dimension SDSs that are not accessed from any 
          other SDSs.  PVN - 2007/4/5
        - hrepack: Fixed a bug that caused the unchunking of a dataset when
          uncompressing was requested.  PVN - 2007/4/5

    Library
    ========= 
        - Added display of the compression method to hdp dumpsds and dumpgr
          (Bugzilla #130).  BMR - 2005/4/4
        - The current SDgetcompress and GRgetcompress APIs have severe flaws.
          Two new APIs, SDgetcompinfo and GRgetcompinfo, were added to 
          provide better functionality and will eventually replace 
          SDgetcompress and GRgetcompress.  BMR - 2005/4/4
        - Applied user's patch to fix bug #602.  BMR - 2005/4/23
        - Added a switch ('u') to ncdump to replace nonalpha-numeric characters
          with underscores.  Thus, the SDS names won't be changed automatically 
          unless the user so requests (Access bug #934/Bugzilla #381).
          BMR - 2005/7/17
        - In HDF4.2r0, SDwritedata failed when the SDS had rank=0 (bug #1045).
          This change was retracted; writing to an SDS with rank=0 is allowed 
          again.  BMR - 2005/8/23
        - When a dimension has the same name as an SDS, depending on the
          order in which they were created, either the SDS or the dimension
          will be corrupted if certain operations occur, such as a SDsetdimscale
          or SDsetattr call to the dimension.  With this bugfix, the current 
          situation can be summarized as below:
              + Data that has already been corrupted cannot be recovered.
              + For existing data that has not yet been corrupted, the problem 
                has been fixed for multi-dimensional SDSs only.  If the SDS had
                only one dimension, the results of subsequent accesses to the 
                dimension would still be unpredictable (Bugzilla #328).  
                BMR - 2005/8/23
              + For future data, the problem has been fixed (Bugzilla #624).
                BMR - 2007/6/24
        - Allowing the maximum number of open files to be increased revealed
          a problem: having more than 255 files open will cause file
          corruption (Bugzilla #440).  Specifically, file number (255*m)+n 
          will overwrite file number n, where n is [0..255] and m is [1..p], 
          where (255*p) <= maximum system allowed.  This problem is fixed.
          In addition, a new API is added for convenience:
                SDgetfilename -- retrieves the name of the file given its ID.
          BMR - 2005/10/05
        - Prior to this release, the maximum number of files that can be open
          at the same time was only 32. This limit was implemented as a 
          defined constant in the library, which users could not change without 
          recompiling the library. In this release, if this limit is reached, 
          the library will increase it to the system limit, minus 3 to account 
          for stdin, stdout, and stderr.  In addition, three APIs are added 
          for more flexibility (Bugzilla #396/Access bug #935):  
                SDreset_maxopenfiles -- Resets the maximum number of files 
                        that can be open at a time.
                SDget_maxopenfiles -- Retrieves the current number of open 
                        files allowed in HDF and the maximum number of open 
                        files allowed on a system.
                SDget_numopenfiles -- Returns the number of files currently 
                        open.
          Note:
            (1) Because there are also stdin, stdout, and stderr, the maximum
                limit that can be set must only be (system limit) - 3.
            (2) If the system maximum limit is reached, the library will 
                push the error code DFE_TOOMANY onto the error stack.
                The user application can detect this after an SDstart fails.
          BMR - 2005/10/21
        - The problem where ncgen failed with "too many attributes" on 
          some user files is fixed (Bugzilla #373).  BMR - 2005/10/28
        - The problem where SDcheckempty returns "not empty" for empty 
          chunked and compressed datasets is fixed (Bugzilla #218).
          BMR - 2005/10/31
        - If a VSgetattr was called twice for an attribute, the second call 
          would fail (Bugzilla #486).  This problem is fixed.  BMR - 2005/12/30
        - A bug with reading metadata in hdfimport is fixed (Bugzilla #558).
          BMR - 2006/9/23
        - The problem of writing to two unlimited 1-D arrays is fixed
          (Access bug #525).  BMR - 2006/11/11

Known problems
==============

o  hdfcomp fails on HPUX 11.23 for the 64-bit version of the library

o  This release does not support VMS systems.

o  N-Bit compression is not supported with Fortran APIs.

o  Using both fill-value and compression on SD datasets does not work.

o  When a one-dimensional SDS has the same name as the dimension, subsequent
   accesses to the dimension produce unpredictable results.

o  When using PGI compilers, make sure that the JPEG library is also compiled 
   with a PGI C compiler; linking with JPEG built with gcc causes JPEG library 
   tests to fail.  To bypass the problem:

       x Set LIBS flag to $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a
         where $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR points to the installation directory
         for the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         setenv LIBS $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a

       x Use the --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR configure flag to 
         configure with the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         ./configure --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR --with-zlib....

Known problems
==============

   Fortran APIs do not support SZIP compression.

o SZIP compression cannot be used with GR interfaces. For more information
  see "HDF4.2r1 SZIP Release Notes" available at 
  http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/doc_resource/SZIP/SZIP_HDF4_2r1.pdf

o  This release doesn't support VMS system.

o  N-Bit compression is not supported with Fortran APIs.

o  Using both fill-value and compression on SD datasets doesn't work.

o  SDgetdimscale incorrectly returns FAIL and or returns incorrect data
   when the associated SDS has the same name as the dimension.

o  When using PGI compilers make sure that JPEG library is also compiled with 
   PGI C compiler; linking with JPEG built with gcc causes JPEG library tests
   to fail.  To bypass the problem

       x Set LIBS flag to $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a
          where $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR points to the installtion directory
          for the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

          setenv LIBS $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a

       x Use  --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR
         configure flag to configure with the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

          ./configure --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR --with-zlib....

New Features and Changes:
========================

o IMPORTANT: HDF4 HAS A NEW CONFIGURATION 

  ZLIB and JPEG libraries were removed from the HDF4 distribution source.
  ZLIB and JPEG have to be installed on the system before HDF4 library
  can be built or HDF4 precompiled binaries can be used.
  Please read INSTALL in the top HDF4 directory for instructions
  how to build the HDF4 library and applications.

o HDF4 has an optional SZIP compression method; in order to use SZIP compression,
  SZIP library has to be installed on the system. Please refer to the INSTALL 
  file for instructions on how to build with/without the SZIP Library.
  SZIP in HDF4 is free for non-commercial use; 
  see http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/doc_resource/SZIP/Commercial_szip.html 
  for information regarding commercial use. 

  For more information about SZIP compression
  see http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/doc_resource/SZIP/ and 
  the "HDF4 Reference Manual" entries for the GRsetcompress and 
  SDsetcompress functions. 

o IMPORTANT note about prebuild binaries:

  NCSA precompiled binaries has SZIP compression method enabled for all platforms
  except Crays T3E and SV1 and Linux 2.4 SuSE x86_64. To use the binaries download
  the SZIP library from http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/doc_resource/SZIP/

o The following new tools have been added

      hrepack
      hdiff
      hdfimport

  See "HDF4 Reference Manual" in the HDF 4.2r0 documentation set for more
  information.

o fp2hdf is removed. It is replaced with hdfimport.

o Helper scripts to facilitate HDF4 installation and compilation were added:
  
      h4cc   - to compile C application with the HDF4 Libraries
      h4fc   - to compiler Fortran applications with the HDF4 Libraries
      h4redeploy - to fix binary installation

  See "HDF4 Reference Manual" in the HDF 4.2r0 documentation set for more
  information.

Support for new platforms 
=========================

o HDF4 was ported to the following platforms

      AIX 5.1 64-bit version
      MacOSX
      Linux 2.4 RH8 and RH9 
      Linux 2.4 RH8 64-bit, SuSE 64-bit
      Linux 2.4 ia64
      Linux 2.4 SGI (Altrix)


Bugs fixed since HDF4.1r5
=========================

1. "hdp dumpgr" and "hdp dumpsds" have two new options:
        -g to suppress the data of global (or file) attributes
        -l to suppress the data of local attributes

2. The problem where hdp failed on a very long file name has been
   fixed. (bug #693)

3. The problem where VSinquire failed when being called on a vdata
   that had no fields defined, has been fixed. (bug #626)

4. When the values of VGNAMELENMAX and VSNAMELENMAX are changed
   the hdp output doesn't reflect the change. This problem is 
   now fixed. (bug #606)

5. hdp dumpvg sometimes failed when reading a file that had a vgroup 
   being inserted into another.  This has been fixed. (bug #477)

6. hdf2gif failed when a user tried it on JPEG compressed images. (Bug #601).
   The problem is now fixed. An error message is displayed if the image is not
   8-bit. If the image is 24-bit, the message suggests using hdf2jpeg.

7. ncdump failed to read NetCDF files 3.5 when there was more than one variable
   with unlimited dimensions. Fixed.

8. The NetCDF part of the HDF4 library was not ported to Compaq True64 system. 
   Fixed.

9. The hdp commands dumpsds, dumpgr, dumpvd, and dumpvg now display an 
    informative message when a non-HDF file is given as input. (Bug #817)

10. The compilation warnings and error on the macro HDFclose are fixed.
    (Bug #818)

Documentation
==============

    Entries for new utilities hdiff, hrepack, hdfimport and helper
    scripts h4cc, h4fc, and h4redeply were added to the Reference Manual.

New Features and Changes:
========================

o The following Vdata routines were added:

     VSsetblocksize/vsfsetblsz -- sets the block size of the 
                                  linked-block element.
     VSsetnumblocks/vsfsetnmbl -- sets the number of blocks for 
                                  a linked-block element.
     VSgetblockinfo/vsfgetblinfo -- retrieves the block size and the number 
                                    of blocks of a linked-block element.

o  Two routines were added to get compression information for the SD and
   GR interfaces, including chunked elements: SDgetcompress/sfgcompress 
   and GRgetcompress/mggcompress. 

   Note: 

   - For a JPEG image, GRgetcompress only returns the compression type, not 
     the compression information (i.e, quantity and force_baseline).  This 
     information is not currently retrievable.

   - Getting compression type for JPEG chunked images is not working yet.

o  "hdp dumpgr" has a new option, -pd, to print palette data only.  Also,
   whenever option -p or -pd is given, only palettes are printed, and no 
   images or file attributes. 

o  A new FORTRAN function, heprntf (HEprint), was added.  It takes two
   arguments: file name and level.  If the file name string has 0 length,
   then error messages will be printed to standard output. 

o  On Windows, the unresolved symbol (error_top) error has been fixed when 
   calling HEclear and linking with the DLL.  Users who want to use the HDF 
   DLL should define HDFAPDLL in their applications.  Simply go to Project 
   Settings and add HDFAPDLL as the predefined constant.

o  A memory leak in the netCDF portion of the HDF/mfhdf distribution
   was fixed. 

o  The "#define NULL" was removed since ANSI C compilers are required to
   define NULL.

o  When using "hdp dumpgr", data was being printed in the range of 0-250
   when it should have been between 0-168.  This problem is now fixed.

Please refer to the bugs_fixed.txt file for more details on bugs that were 
fixed.

New Features and Changes:
========================

This release focuses on new features and changes added to the
GR interface.

o Two new utilities have been added to HDF, gif2hdf and hdf2gif.
  The gif2hdf utility will convert a GIF image into an HDF file
  containing a GR image. The hdf2gif utility will convert an HDF GR 
  image into a GIF image. 
  
o Chunking and chunking with compression have been added to the
  GR interface.

o JPEG compression with the GR interface was not working properly.
  This problem has been fixed.

Several hdp options have been added:
  
o Added -s option to dumpgr and dumpsds to allow printing data 
  as a stream instead of breaking the lines at 65 characters. 

o Added option -c to dumpgr and dumpsds to allow printing clean output 
  for attributes with type DFNT_CHAR. With this option, hdp will print 
  space characters, such as horizontal tabs, CRs, and LFs, as they are 
  instead of "\digit" (still the default.)  This option also prints "..." 
  for one or more null characters among the data.

o Added option -l to dumpgr to allow printing data in different interlace
  modes.


Platforms Tested:

New Features and Changes:
========================

o HDF 4.1r2 was unable to properly read HDF SDSs created with HDF 3.3x.
  It did not read the correct SDS names.  This problem has been fixed.

o Many problems have been fixed with the GR interface, including the
  following:

  - The GR interface can now read compressed files created with the 
    DFR8 and DF24 interfaces, except for those which were compressed 
    with IMCOMP compression.
  
  - The GR interface can read and write images compressed with RLE, 
    GZIP and Skipping Huffman compression methods.

  - Palettes can now be written and read properly with the GR interface.

  - 24-bit raster images can now be read by the GR interface.

o You can now create an SDS with a name up to 256 characters in length.
  The previous limit was 64.

o HDF now supports IJP JPEG version 6b and Gzip version 1.1.3.

o Numerous hdp problems have been fixed, including the following:

  - hdp no longer fails on an HDF file which contains a vdata that no 
    records have been written to.

  - hdp no longer fails on the PC and Mactinosh dumping large SDSs.

  - GR file attributes can now be displayed.

  - A palette can now be dumped with the GR command.

o SDfileinfo no longer returns the wrong number of datasets for old
  files created with the DFSD interface.

o This will be the last release that SunOS 4.1.4 is supported.

Check the ./bugs_fixed.txt for other changes that are not listed
here.

                            March 16, 1998

INTRODUCTION

This document describes the differences between HDF 4.1r1 and
HDF 4.1r2.  It is written for people who are familiar with
previous releases of HDF and wish to migrate to HDF 4.1r2.
The release notes provide more in-depth information concerning

New Features and Changes:
========================

o Data chunking is now supported with the GR interface.  New routines
  for creating and manipulating chunked GR images have been added.  Please
  refer to the ./release_notes/new_functions.txt file and HDF Reference 
  Manual for information on using chunked GRs.

o In previous releases, many C routines existed for which there were  
  no Fortran counterparts.  With HDF 4.1r2, we have added a Fortran 
  routine for most C routines.  Please check the 
  ./release_notes/new_functions.txt file for a list of the new 
  functions added to HDF.

o This is the first release in which the Java Products (the Java-based
  HDF Viewer (JHV) and the Java HDF interface (JHI)) are incorporated in 
  the HDF release itself.  For information on the Java Products, please
  refer to the HDF home page under Information about HDF
  (http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/about.html).

o In the SD interface, HDF now defaults to ONLY storing the new version 
  of the dimension representation added in HDF 4.0r1. 

  When the dimension representation was changed in 4.0r1, the HDF library 
  defaulted to include both the new and old dimension representations in 
  an HDF file.  Now, this new dimension representation is stored by default.
  The SDsetdimval_comp function can be used to change the dimension 
  representation stored.
 
  Following is a detailed description of the difference between the
  new and old representations:

    Prior to HDF 4.0r1, a vgroup was used to represent a dimension.  The 
    vgroup had a single field vdata with a class of "DimVal0.0".  The vdata 
    had <dimension size> number of records, with each record having a fake 
    value from 0, 1, 2 ... , (<dimension size> - 1).  The fake values were 
    not really required and took up a large amount of space. For applications 
    that created large one dimensional array datasets, the disk space taken by 
    these fake values almost doubled the size of the HDF file. In order to omit 
    the fake values, the new version for a dimension vdata was implemented.
 
    The new version uses the same structure as the old version.  The
    only differences are that the vdata has only 1 record with a value
    of <dimension size> and that the vdata's class is "DimVal0.1",  to
    distinguish it from the old version.

o Platforms dropped with this release:  Cray Y-MP, T3D, and Linux (a.out)  

o Extensive changes have been made to the Reference Manual and User's
  Guide.  The updated Reference Manual is available with this release.  The
  updated User's Guide will be available in the near future.


Platforms Tested:
================

HDF 4.1 Release 2 has been tested on the following platforms:

   Cray T90 (CFP, IEEE)            IRIX 6.2 
   Cray T3E                        IRIX64 6.4 (-n32, -64)

   HP-UX 10.2                      SunOS 
   IRIX 5.3                   

** The Windows NT/95, Macintosh, Dec Alpha OpenVMS and VAX OpenVMS 
   releases are not available with this release of HDF4.1r2.  Separate 
   releases for these platforms will be available in the near future. 

For more information on the platforms that were tested and for
which we provide pre-compiled binaries, please refer to the following
web page (accessible from the HDF home page):

     http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/platforms.html

Known Problems:
==============

o Writing n-bit datasets from FORTRAN with the SD interface is not working.

o SDgetchunkinfo does not return compression coding or modeling type.

o Using both fill-values and compression on SD datasets is not currently
  working; don't use one or the other.

o Dumping compressed Vdatas with vshow or hdp is not working.

o Reading or writing compressed images with the GR interface is not working.

o With the GR interface, you cannot create a raster image without writing data 
  to it.


Important Fixes:
===============

o HDF no longer core dumps when reading a NetCDF file.

o HDF now supports little-endian conversion for VAX and Dec 
  Alpha OpenVMS.

o The problems that occurred on the Cray with HDF 4.1r1 have
  been corrected.

New Features and Changes:
========================

o Attributes are now supported in both the vdata and vgroup 
  APIs.  In the vdata API, attributes can be attached to either 
  vdata fields or vdatas; in the vgroup API, attributes can be 
  attached to vgroups.  This new functionality can also be used
  to attach attributes to vdatas and vgroups created by earlier
  versions of the HDF library.  However, the old versions of
  the HDF library cannot read the new version vdatas and vgroups.
  A vdata/vgroup having attributes will become a new version 
  vdata/vgroup.  For more information, please refer to the file 
  ../release_notes/vattr.txt, the man pages for the new functions, 
  and the HDF 4.1 User's Guide.

o Data chunking is now supported in SD scientific data sets.  
  When data chunking is used, an n-dimensional SDS is stored 
  as a series of n-dimensional chunks, improving performance on 
  certain types of partial read operations.

  New routines for creating and manipulating chunked SD 
  scientific data sets have been provided, and two preexisting 
  SD I/O routines, SDreaddata and SDwritedata, have also been 
  modified to work with chunked SDSs.  For more information, please 
  refer to the file ../release_notes/sd_chunk_examples.txt, the man
  page for sd_chunk, and the HDF 4.1 User's Guide.

o Due to certain limitations in the way compressed SDS datasets are stored, 
  data which has been compressed is not completely writable in ways that 
  uncompressed datasets are.  The "rules" for writing to a compressed 
  dataset are as follows:

    (1) Write an entire dataset that is to be compressed.  i.e. build the
        dataset entirely in memory, then write it out with a single call.
 
    (2) Append to a compressed dataset.  i.e. write to a compressed dataset
        that has already been written out by adding to the unlimited
        dimension for that dataset.
 
    (3) For users of HDF 4.1, write to any subset of a compressed dataset
        that is also chunked.  

  Please refer to the HDF 4.1 User's Guide for more information.

o HDF now creates free format FORTRAN include files.  In order to make 
  FORTRAN 90 programs be able to use HDF include files (*.inc), HDF4.1r1 
  creates F90 versions of these files during the 'make' process on UNIX 
  platforms, by replacing 'C' or 'c' in column 1 with '!'.  Continuation 
  lines in hdf.inc have been eliminated. The F90 version files are named 
  as hdf.f90, dffunc.f90 and netcdf.f90.

o Several performance improvements have been added. Test programs on SPARC
  20/Solaris 2.5 show that when creating an hdf file with 2500 3D (10x10x10)
  float32 SDSs, the program execution speed is improved by 2.5 - 4.8 times,
  and SDend is faster by 4.3 - 20 times.

o A new function, SDsetfillmode, has been added.  It can be used to prevent 
  SDwritedata from pre-filling the dataset with a user defined or default 
  fill value, so that better performance can be obtained.

o SGI has changed some compiler default settings in IRIX 6.2.
  We decided to explicitly define the settings of various ABI related
  options.  For the 64 bit OS ("uname -s" returns IRIX64), HDF uses
  "-64 -mips4" code.  For the traditional 32 bit OS ("uname -s" returns
  IRIX), HDF uses "-32 -mips2".  To use n32 mode on IRIX64, HDF uses
  "-n32 -mips3" code.  Note that in the previous release (4.0r2), HDF
  used only "-n32".  In IRIX 6.1 and before, "-n32" defaulted to
  "-mips4" code but in IRIX 6.2, it defaults to mips3 or mips4 code.
  We decided to explicitly set it to "-n32 -mips3".  Therefore,
  applications linking with the HDF library must be compiled with
  the same explicit ABI options.

o This will be the last release that we support the CM5.

  HDF 4.1 Beta 1 USERS ONLY
  -------------------------

o The SD chunking routine names were changed to be more consistent
  with the SD interface. The names of the routines are now in lower
  case, after the two initial "SD" characters.  For example,
  SDwriteChunk() has been changed to SDwritechunk().

o The _HDF_ENTIRE_VDATA variable has been changed to _HDF_VDATA.
  For those users already using it, a macro called _HDF_ENTIRE_VDATA
  has been added, which is defined as _HDF_VDATA.

o You can now create an empty compressed SDS.

  Please refer to the ../release_notes/bugs_fixed.txt file for changes 
  in this release.
 
Platforms Tested:
================

HDF 4.1 Release 1 has been tested on the following platforms:

  CM5 Parallel I/O, 4.1.3_U1
  DEC Alpha/Digital Unix 3.2
  DEC Alpha/OpenVMS AXP 6.2
  DEC VAX OpenVMS 6.2
  Exemplar 9.03
  Free BSD 2.2
  HP-UX 9.03
  HP-UX 10.10
  IRIX 5.3
  IRIX 6.2_64
  IRIX 6.2_n32 
  IRIX 6.4_64
  IRIX 6.4_n32
  Linux A.OUT 1.2.4
  Linux ELF 2.0.27 (C only)
  Macintosh PowerPC (C only) 
  SP2 4.1
  Solaris 2.5
  Solaris_x86 2.5 (C only)
  SunOS 4.1.3
  Windows NT/95 (C only)

Known Problems:
==============

o With the SD interface, you are unable to overwrite
  existing compressed data, that is not stored in
  "chunked" form.  This is due to compression algorithms 
  not being suitable for "local" modifications in a compressed 
  datastream.   

o There are no plans to add the DF24writeref function 
  to the DF24 interface.  This function will be removed
  from the documentation.

Important Fixes:
===============

o If you opened a file in Read Only mode with the SD interface
  (using SDstart), it would create the file if the file did not
  exist.  This no longer occurs.

o HDF 4.0r2 did not recognize JPEG images created by HDF 3.3r4.
  This has been fixed.

See the ../release_notes/bugs_fixed.txt file for more information
on bugs fixed in this release.

New Features and Changes:
-------------------------

o Attributes are now supported in both the vdata and vgroup 
  APIs.  In the vdata API, attributes can be attached to either 
  vdata fields or vdatas; in the vgroup API, attributes can be 
  attached to vgroups.  This new functionality can be used
  to attach attributes to vdatas and vgroups created by earlier
  versions of the HDF library.  However, the old versions of
  the HDF library cannot read the new version vdatas and vgroups.
  A vdata/vgroup having attributes will become a new version 
  vdata/vgroup.  For more information, please refer to the file 
  ../release_notes/vattr.txt, as well as the man pages for the
  new functions.

o Data chunking is now supported in SD scientific data sets.  
  When data chunking is used, an n-dimensional SDS is stored 
  as a series of n-dimensional chunks, improving performance on 
  certain types of partial read operations.

  New routines for creating and manipulating chunked SD 
  scientific data sets have been provided, and two preexisting 
  SD I/O routines, SDreaddata and SDwritedata, have also been 
  modified to work with chunked SDSs.  For more information, please 
  refer to the file ../release_notes/sd_chunk_examples.txt, as
  well as the man page for sd_chunk.

  More information will be included in the HDF 4.1 documentation,
  which will be available with the release of HDF 4.1.  

o Due to certain limitations in the way compressed SDS datasets are stored, 
  data which has been compressed is not completely writable in ways that 
  uncompressed datasets are.  The "rules" for writing to a compressed 
  dataset are as follows:

    (1) Write an entire dataset that is to be compressed.  i.e. build the
        dataset entirely in memory, then write it out with a single call.
 
    (2) Append to a compressed dataset.  i.e. write to a compressed dataset
        that has already been written out by adding to the unlimited
        dimension for that dataset.
 
    (3) For users of HDF 4.1, write to any subset of a compressed dataset
        that is also chunked.  

  Please refer to the ../release_notes/comp_SDS.txt file for more information.

o A new file, ../release_notes/compile.txt, contains instructions on
  compiling applications on the supported platforms.  If you encounter
  problems with it, please let us know at hdfhelp@ncsa.uiuc.edu. 

o SGI has changed some compiler default settings in IRIX 6.2.
  We decided to explicitly define the settings of various ABI related
  options.  For the 64 bit OS ("uname -s" returns IRIX64), HDF uses
  "-64 -mips4" code.  For the traditional 32 bit OS ("uname -s" returns
  IRIX), HDF uses "-32 -mips2".  To use n32 mode on IRIX64, HDF uses
  "-n32 -mips3" code.  Note that in the previous release (4.0r2), HDF
  used only "-n32".  In IRIX 6.1 and before, "-n32" defaulted to
  "-mips4" code but in IRIX 6.2, it defaults to mips3 or mips4 code.
  We decided to explicitly set it to "-n32 -mips3".  Therefore,
  applications linking with the HDF library must be compiled with
  the same explicit ABI options.

Platforms Tested:
-----------------

HDF 4.1b1 has been tested on the following platforms:

  DEC Alpha/Digital Unix 3.2
  DEC Alpha/OpenVMS AXP v6.2
  DEC VAX OpenVMS v6.2
  Free BSD 2.2
  HP-UX 9.03
  IRIX 5.3
  IRIX 6.2_64
  IRIX 6.2_n32 
  Linux ELF 1.2.13 (C only)
  Macintosh PowerPC (C only) (not ready yet)
  SP2 4.1
  Solaris 2.5
  SunOS 4.1.3
  Windows NT/95 (C only)
  YMP 9.0.2asC

Known Problems:
---------------

o With the SD interface, you are unable to overwrite
  existing compressed data, that is not stored in
  "chunked" form.  This is due to compression algorithms 
  not being suitable for "local" modifications in a compressed 
  datastream.  For more information, please refer to 
  the ../release_notes/comp_SDS.txt file. 

o With 4.0r1p1, you could type "hdp list -a <HDF file>
  to get a list of the file attributes associated with
  a file.  This does not currently work.

o There are no plans to add the DF24writeref function 
  to the DF24 interface.  This function will be removed
  from the documentation.

o When running "make test" on OpenVMS, Test 3 (float32) of the 
  chunking tests fails, and has therefore been commented out.

o When running the tests on Window NT/95, Test 2 (uint16) of the
  chunking tests fails, and will be commented out.
 

Important Fixes:
----------------

o If you opened a file in Read Only mode with the SD interface
  (using SDstart), it would create the file if the file did not
  exist.  This no longer occurs.

o HDF 4.0r2 did not recognize JPEG images created by HDF 3.3r4.
  This has been fixed.

See the ../release_notes/bug_fixed.txt file for more information
on bugs fixed in this release.

New Features and Changes:
-------------------------

o HDF now supports unlimited number of access IDs and files IDs.

o The vdata field size limit has been increased from 32000 to 65535.

o The hdp utility has been updated to:
   - view a GR object
   - recognize the new compression methods
   - view descriptive annotations
   - display the library version of the HDF file

o SDsetattr and GRsetattr now check for both MAX_ORDER and 
  MAX_FIELD_SIZE.

o The handling of DFNT_CHAR in all Fortran interfaces has been 
  cleaned up.  See release_notes/Fortran_APIs.txt for more 
  information.

o When appending compressed data onto the end of an unlimited
  dimension SDS, the SD interface no longer writes the fill-values
  in locations where they will immediately be over-written by data.
  This was done for the compression layer, but has the added
  enhancement of improving performance.

o On the Cray, there were boundary problems when foreign data did not
  start from the 64-bit boundary.  This has been fixed.

o There are no longer the following name collisions with the HDF 
  libraries:
     -  AVS (HPread, HPwrite)
     -  Windows SDK (_hread) 
     -  ODL library (_HDF_<constant>)

o The 32-bit mode for IRIX 6.1 previously used the '-32' option which
  produces mips1 code.  It has been changed to use '-n32' which
  produces mips4 code.  This runs faster on the Power Challenges.
  Users who must use the '-32' option can link their code with
  the IRIX 5.3 HDF library.

o The compression problems have been fixed when using HDF on IRIX 6.1 
  with the -n32 (see Known Problems below).

o The zlib and jpeg libraries have been updated.  The versions included
  with HDF 4.0 Release 2 are:

      zlib version 1.0.2
      jpeg version 6a (7-Feb-96)
       
o The hdfls utility has been updated to:
    - support the new compression modes
    - display the library version of the HDF file

o Support for the 16-bit architecture has been pulled out of HDF.

o The directories separator in the directory variable used by the
  function HXsetdir (Fortran equivalent: hxsdir) is the verticle bar
  ('|') now.  It used to be the colon (':') symbol, but a colon is
  a legal symbol for a file pathname in the MacOS system.

o The code has been rearranged so that most applications' binaries
  will be smaller.

o A new routine, VSfpack(), has been added.  Please see the HDF man
  page on how to use this routine.

o A new routine, GRluttoref(), has been added.  Please see the HDF man
  page on how to use this routine. 

o Several internal problems have been fixed with the GR interface.


Changes in Compiling the Source Code:

o A new compile option, '-DHAVE_NETCDF', has been added, to avoid conflicts 
  in linking the HDF/MFHDF library with the original netCDF library. 
  This is only available for the C-interface.  However, keep in 
  mind that you cannot read/write HDF files using the netCDF libraries.  
  See section 2.4.3.2 in the INSTALL file for more information.  

o When compiling and installing HDF, the default location to place the
  binaries, has been changed from /usr/local/bin to NewHDF in the
  source directory.  For example, assuming the library source is loaded 
  at /usr/local/src/hdf, the following commands will result in the HDF 
  binaries being placed in the directory /usr/local/src/hdf/dev/NewHDF.

        cd dev
        ./configure -v
        make 
        make test
        make install

o The Fortran test output has been cleaned up and shortened, when 
  running "make test".  Previously, the Fortran tests on the hdf/
  side consisted of multiple Fortran programs invoked by a C frontend.  
  The test programs were changed to subroutines and combined as one 
  Fortran program.  The C frontend was also changed to produce a 
  'directive' file, called fortest.arg, which contains directives to 
  run the Fortran test program.


Platforms Tested:
-----------------

HDF 4.0r2 has been tested on the following platforms:

  AIX                           Linux ELF
  C90                           MAC 
  CM5                           SP2  (single node)
  Digital Unix 3.2              Solaris_2.4
  Exemplar 9.03                 Solaris 2.5
  Free BSD                      Solaris_x86 2.4  (C only)
  Fujitsu  (C only)             SunOS 4.1.4
  HP-UX                         T3D  (C only)
  IRIX 6.1 w/-n32 bit option    VMS
  IRIX 6.1 w/-64 bit option     Windows NT/95
  IRIX 5.3                      YMP
  Linux A.OUT                   


Known Problems:
---------------

o On the SunOS platform, there is a bug when using sfscal()/sfgcal() 
  routines with gcc and f77.
 
o On the VMS platform, there is a bug with float64 data.

o For IRIX 6.1, the stdio.h file gives a false warning message if both 
  the '-n32' and '-ansi' options are used for the C compiler.  We have 
  temporarily removed the '-ansi' option from our autoconfiguration
  for the Irix6_32 system, to avoid these messages.  We have verified
  that the culprit in stdio.h has been corrected in IRIX 6.2, and plan
  to put the '-ansi' option back in our next release.

o The compression tests produce errors for FLOAT32 data if the '-O'
  option is used on IRIX 6.1, for both the '-64' bit and '-n32'
  bit modes.  It did not produce errors when using the '-32' bit 
  option or when not using the '-O' option.  We are unsure whether the 
  errors are due to the compression code or the IRIX C optimizer.  For 
  now, we have chosen to compile the HDF library without the '-O' option, 
  while we investigate the problem.

Important Changes: 
-----------------

  1. Several changes have been made to the libraries in HDF4.0
     which affect the way that users compile and link their
     programs:

      * The mfhdf library has been renamed to libmfhdf.a from 
        libnetcdf.a in previous releases.

      * HDF 4.0 libraries now use v5 of the Independent JPEG Group 
        (IJG) JPEG file access library.

      * Gzip library libz.a is added in HDF4.0r1, in order to 
        support "deflate" style compression of any object in 
        HDF files.

     Due to these changes, users are required to specify four
     libraries when compiling and linking a program:  libmfhdf.a,
     libdf.a, libjpeg.a and libz.a, even if your program
     does not use JPEG or GZIP compression.  For example:

     For C:

        cc -o myprog myprog.c -I<path of include files> \
              <path of libmfhdf.a> <path of libdf.a> \
              <path of libjpeg.a> <path of libz.a>
       or
  
        cc -o myprog myprog.c -I<path of include files> \
              -L<path of libraries> -lmfhdf -ldf -ljpeg -lz

     For FORTRAN:

        f77 -o myprog myprog.f <path of libmfhdf.a> \
              <path of libdf.a> <path of libjpeg.a> \
              <path of libz.a>
       or
   
        f77 -o myprog myprog.f -L<path of libraries> \
              -lmfhdf -ldf  -ljpeg -lz

     NOTE: The order of the libraries is important: libmfhdf.a
           first, then libdf.a, followed by libjpeg.a and libz.a.
     
     This is also discussed in Items 1, 2, and 3 of the New 
     Features and Changes section of this document.

  2. The HDF 4.0 library will ONLY compile with ANSI C compilers.
     See Item 4 in the New Features and Changes section of this
     document for more information.

  3. The HDF library and netCDF library on Unix systems can now be 
     automatically configured and built with one command.  See Item 5 
     in the New Features and Changes section of this document for more
     information.

  4. In HDF 4.0, the FORTRAN programs dffunct.i and constant.i
     have been changed to dffunct.inc and hdf.inc.  See Item 16 in
     the New Features and Changes section of this document for more 
     information.
  
  5. Platforms tested on: IRIX (5.3, 6.1 (32 bit and 64 bit)), 
     SunOS 4.1.4, Solaris (ver 2.4, 2.5), Solaris x86, 
     HP-UX, Digital Unix, AIX, LINUX (A.OUT), CM5, YMP,
     FreeBSD, C90, Exemplar, Open VMS, and SP2 (single node only). 

     HDF 4.0 is not yet available on the Macintosh for HDF4.0r1.

  6. The HDF 4.0 binaries for each tested platform are available. 
     Unix binaries are located in the bin/ directory.  Binaries for 
     Windows NT are located in the zip/ directory. 
     

New Features and Changes:
------------------------

  1. Changes to the mfhdf library
     The mfhdf library has been renamed to libmfhdf.a from libnetcdf.a 
     in previous releases. To link a program with HDF4.0r1
     libraries, four libraries are required:  libmfhdf.a, libdf.a, 
     libjpeg.a and libz.a. 

     See Item 1 of 'Important Changes' for examples of how you would 
     compile and link your programs.

  2. JPEG Group v5b library
     HDF Version 4.0 libraries now use v5 of the Independent 
     JPEG Group (IJG) JPEG file access library.

     The JPEG library will need to be linked with user's 
     applications whether they are compressed with JPEG or not.

     See Item 1 of 'Important Changes' for examples of how you would 
     compile and link your programs.

  3. Gzip library added
     New with this release is support for gzip "deflate" style 
     compression of any object in an HDF file.  This is supported 
     through the standard compression interface function calls 
     (HCcreate, SDsetcompress, GRsetcompress).  The ABOUT_4.0b2 
     file contains additional information on this. 

     See Item 1 of 'Important Changes' for examples of how you would 
     compile and link your programs.

  4. ANSI C only
     As was previously noted in the HDF newsletters, this release 
     of the HDF library will compile only with ANSI C compilers. 
     This shift to ANSI C compliance has been accompanied by a large 
     clean up in the source code. An attempt has been made to remove 
     all warnings and informational messages that the compilers on 
     supported platforms occasionally emit, but this may not be 
     completely clean for all user sites. 

  5. Auto configuration 
     Both the HDF library and netCDF library on Unix systems now use 
     the same configure script and can be configured uniformally with 
     one command. See the README and the INSTALL files at the top 
     level of HDF4.0r1 for detailed instructions on configuration and 
     installation.

     A consequence of the auto configuration is that on UNIX systems 
     without FORTRAN installed, the top level config/mh-<sys> will 
     need to have the 'FC' macros defined to "NONE" for correct 
     configuration. 
     
  6. New version of dimension record
     In HDF4.0b1 and previous releases of the SDS interface, a vgroup 
     was used to represent a dimension.  The vgroup had a single field 
     vdata with a class of "DimVal0.0".  The vdata had <dimension size> 
     number of records, with each record having a fake value from 
     0, 1, 2 ... , (<dimension size> - 1).  The fake values were not 
     really required and took up a large amount of space. For 
     applications that created large one dimensional array datasets, the 
     disk space taken by these fake values almost doubled the size of the 
     HDF file. In order to omit the fake values, a new version of 
     dimension vdata was implemented.

     The new version uses the same structure as the old version.  The 
     only differences are that the vdata has only 1 record with a value
     of <dimension size> and that the vdata's class is "DimVal0.1",  to
     distinguish it from the old version.

     No change was made in unlimited dimensions.

     Functions added to support this are:
     
       - SDsetdimval_comp -- sets backward compatibility mode for a 
         dimension.  The default mode is compatible in HDF4.0r1, and 
         will be incompatible in HDF4.1. See the man page of 
         SDsetdimval_comp(3) for detail.

       - SDisdimval_bwcomp(dimid) -- gets the backward compatibility
         mode of a dimension. See the man page of SDisdimval_bwcomp(3) 
         for detail.

  7. Reading CDF files
     With HDF 4.0 limited support for reading CDF files was added to 
     the library. This support is still somewhat in the development 
     stage and is therefore limited. 

     To begin with, unlike the netCDF merger, the CDF API is not 
     supported. Rather, the SD and netCDF APIs can be used to access 
     information pulled out of CDF files. 

     The type of files supported are limited to CDF 2.X files. The 
     header information is different between CDF 1.X and 2.X files. In 
     addition, all of the files must be stored as single-file CDFs in 
     network encoding. 

     If there is user demand, and support, the types of CDF files 
     that are readable may be increased in the future. 

  8. Parallel I/O interface on CM5 
     An extension using the parallel IO in CM5 has been added to
     the SDS interface. Initial tests have resulted in about
     25 MBytes/second IO throughput using the SDA (Scalable
     Disk Array) file system. The library provides interfaces
     for both C* and CMF programming languages. The ABOUT_4.0.alpha
     file has more information concerning this.

     Users will find some examples in the directory
     mfhdf/CM5/Examples.

     The parallel I/O interface stores scientific datasets in
     external files.  New options have been added to hdfls and
     hdfpack to handle them.  A new utility, hdfunpac, was
     created for external files handling, too. 

  9. Support for SGI Power Challenge running IRIX6.1 
     Power Challenge is now supported, both in the native 64-bit 
     and the 32-bit objects modes.  Note that the Power Challenge 
     native 64 bits objects use 64 bits long integers. Users should
     be careful when using the netcdf interface.  They should declare 
     their variables as "nclong", not "long". 

 10. Multi-file Annotation Interface (ANxxx)
     The multi-file annotation Interface is for accessing 
     file labels and descriptions, and object labels and 
     descriptions. It allows users to keep open more than 
     one file at a time, and to access more than one 
     annotation at a time.  It also allows multiple labels 
     and multiple descriptions to be applied to an HDF object 
     or HDF file. 
   
 11. Multi-file Raster Image (GRxxx) interface
     The new Generic Raster (GR) interface provides a set of 
     functions for manipulating raster images of all kinds.  
     This interface allows users to keep open more than one 
     file at a time, and to "attach" more than one raster 
     image at a time.  It supports a general framework 
     for attributes within the RIS data-model, allowing 
     'name = value' style metadata.  It allows access to 
     subsamples and subsets of images.  
 
     The GRreqlutil and GRreqimageil functions allow for different 
     methods of interlacing images in memory.  The images are 
     interlaced in memory only, and are actually written to disk in 
     "pixel" interlacing.

 12. Compression for HDF SDS
     Two new compression functions have been added to the SD
     interface for HDF 4.0:  SDsetcompress and SDsetnbitdataset.

     SDsetcompress allows users to compress a scientific dataset 
     using any of several compression methods.  Initially three 
     schemes, RLE encoding, an adaptive Huffman compression 
     algorithm,  and  gzip 'deflation' compression are available. 

     SDsetnbitdataset allows for storing a scientific dataset 
     using integers whose size is any number of bits between 1 and 
     32 (instead of being restricted to 8, 16 or 32-bit sizes). 
     Access to the data stored in an n-bit data item is transparent
     to the calling program.  The ABOUT_4.0.alpha file has an in-depth
     description concerning this ("n-bit SDS" listed under Item 2).  

 13. External Path Handling
     New functions have been added to allow applications to 
     specify directories to create or search for external 
     files.  
     
      - HXsetcreatedir (hxscdir for FORTRAN) 
      - HXsetdir (hxsdir for FORTRAN)

 14. I/O performance improvement 
     HDF 4.0 unofficially supports file page buffering.  With HDF 4.1
     it will be officially supported.  The file page buffering allows 
     the file to be mapped to user memory on a per page basis i.e. a 
     memory pool of the file.  With regards to the file system, page 
     sizes can be allocated based on the file system page-size or 
     in a multiple of the file system page-size. This allows for fewer 
     pages to be managed as well as accommodating the user's file usage 
     pattern.  See the top level INSTALL file and the 
     release_notes/page_buf.txt file for creating the library with
     this support and using it.
     
 15. Improvement in memory usage and general optimizations
     Considerable effort was put into this release (since the b2 
     release) to reduce the amount of memory used per file and by the 
     library in general.  In general terms, we believe that the library 
     should have at least half as large of a memory footprint during 
     the course of its execution and is more frugal about allocating 
     large chunks of memory.
 
     Much time was spent optimizing the low-level HDF routines for this 
     release to be faster than they have been in the past also.  
     Applications which make use of files with many (1000+) datasets 
     should notice significant improvements in execution speed.
 
 16. In hdf/ there are two files for FORTRAN programs to include
     the values and functions defined in HDF. They were
     originally named as constant.i and dffunct.i. The extension .i
     caused problems on some machines since *.i is used by cc as
     an "intermediate" file produced by the cpp preprocessor. In
     HDF 4.0 dffunct.i has been changed to dffunct.inc, and constant.i 
     has been changed to hdf.inc. Users' existing FORTRAN application
     programs need to make the corresponding changes, if they
     include the .i files, in order to compile with HDF4.0. 

 17. Limits file
     A new file, limits.txt, has been added to the ftp server.  
     It is aimed at HDF applications programmers and defines the
     upper bounds of HDF 4.0. This information is also found in the
     hdf/src/hlimits.h file.  Refer to the ABOUT_4.0.alpha for 
     historical information concerning this.

 18. Pablo available
     HDF4.0 supports creating an instrumented version of the HDF 
     library(libdf-inst.a). This library, along with the Pablo 
     performance data capture libraries, can be used to gather data 
     about I/O behavior and procedure execution times.  See the top
     level INSTALL file and the hdf/pablo/README.Pablo file for
     further information.

 19. Support for the IBM SP-2 
     The HDF library has been ported to run in a single SP2 node.
     It does not support the parallel or distributed computing for
     multiple SP-2 nodes yet.

 20. Miscellaneous fixes

     - To avoid conflicts with C++, internal structures' fields which
       were named 'new' have been renamed.

     - The maximum number of fields in a vdata now is decided by 
       VSFIELDMAX.

     - The platform number subclass problem when an external data file 
       was in Little_endian format has been fixed.

     - Unlimited dimension was not handled correctly by the HDF3.3r4
       FORTRAN interface.  This problem has been fixed in HDF4.0r1.

Changes to utilities:
--------------------

   o hdf/util/ristosds 
     Ristosds now converts several raster images into a 3D uint8, 
     instead of float32, SDS. 

   o hdf/util/hdfls
     New options have been added to support the parallel I/O
     interface on CM5.

   o hdf/util/hdfpack
     New options have been added to support the parallel I/O
     interface on CM5.

   o hdf/util/hdfunpac
     This is a new utility for external file handling for the
     parallel I/O interface on CM5.

   o mfhdf/dumper/hdp
     Hdp is a new command line utility designed for quick display of 
     contents and data objects.  It can list the contents of hdf files 
     at various levels with different details.  It can also dump the 
     data of one or more specific objects in the file.  See hdp.txt in 
     the release notes for more information.

Known Problems:
--------------

   o On the IRIX4 platform, fp2hdf creates float32 and float64 values
     incorrectly.   

   o On the SP2, the hdp command gives a false message of "Failure to
     allocate space" when the hdf file has no annotations to list. 

   o On the C90, hdfed fails inconsistently when opening hdf files
     more than once in the same hdfed session.

   o Currently there is a problem in re-writing data in the middle
     of compressed objects.
  
   o VMS gives an error on the test for Little Endian float64.

   o If the external element test in hdf/test/testhdf fails
     and there is no subdirectory "testdir" in hdf/test/,
     create one via "mkdir" and run the test again. (The
     "testdir" should have been created by "make". But
     the "make" in some old systems does not support the
     creation commands.)

     8. Changes in release notes 
     9. Bug fixes and Known problems


1. The mfhdf side library is renamed to libmfhdf.a, versus libnetcdf.a 
   in previous releases. To link a program with HDF4.0b2 libraries, 
   one needs four libraries, libmfhdf.a, libdf.a, libjpeg.a and libz.a 
   (see "Gzip library is added" in item 3 below):

      cc -o myprog myprog.c -I<path of include files> \
            libmfhdf.a libdf.a libjpeg.a libz.a

   Note, the order of the libraries is important.

2. New version of dimension record  
   HDF4.0b1 and previous releases use a vgroup to represent a dimension.
   The vgroup has a single field vdata with class "DimVal0.0".
   The vdata has <dimension size> number of records, each record has a
   fake value from 0, 1, 2 ... , (<dimension size> - 1 ). The fake values
   are not really required and take a lot of space. For applications that
   create large one dimensional array datasets the disk space taken by
   these fake values almost double the size of the HDF file. In order to
   omit the fake values, a new version of dimension vdata is proposed.

   The new version uses the same structure as the old version. The only
   differences are that the vdata has only 1 record with value
   <dimension size> and that the vdata's class is "DimVal0.1" to
   distinguish it from the old version. 

   No change is made in Unlimited dimensions. 
   
   See file dimval.txt in subdirectoy release_notes/ of HDF4.0b2 release
   for our policy on the backward compatibility of this dimension version.

3. New features
   . New with this beta release is the support for different methods of
     interlacing images in memory.  This feature is supported through the 
     GRreqlutil and GRreqimageil functions rescribed in the mf_ris.txt 
     document in this directory.  Please note that the images are 
     interlaced in memory only, all images are actually written to disk 
     in "pixel" interlacing.

   . Gzip library is added
     New with this release is support for gzip "deflate" style compression
     of any object in an HDF file.  This is supported through the standard
     compression interface function calls (HCcreate, SDsetcompress,
     GRsetcompress) by using the COMP_CODE_DEFLATE parameter for the coding
     type.  The comp_info structure has a new member, deflate.level, which
     specifies how much effort to expend trying to compress data.  Values
     for deflate.level must be between 1-9, with 1 being small amounts of
     effort (time) and 9 being maximum effort (most time and compression),
     the default value is 6.
     Currently, due to our use of the gzip "zlib" library for support of
     this feature, users must link with the "libz.a" library produced by
     zlib.  (See item1 above). 

          cc -o myprog myprog.c -I<path of include files> \
                  libmfhdf.a libdf.a libjpeg.a libz.a

     Note, the order of the libraries is important. 

     Also, this method of compression currently has several known bugs 
     when used on a 64-bit architecture (DEC Alpha processors, Cray 
     machines, and SGI Power Challenge machines in 64-bit "mode").

   . Unified configuration of library
     Both sides of the library now use the same configure script and
     can be configured uniformly through one makefile fragment. Please
     see the top-level INSTALL file in the distribution for further 
     details.

   . I/O performance improvement 
     This version of the distribution also has preliminary support for 
     file page buffering. Note that is a *Beta* release and is not 
     supported officially. As such it is is provided as is.
     The file page buffering allows the file to be mapped to user memory on 
     a per page basis i.e a memory pool of the file. With regards to the 
     file system, page sizes can be allocated based on the file system 
     page-size or if the user wants in some multiple of the file system 
     page-size. This allows for fewer pages to be managed along with 
     accommodating the users file usage pattern. Please see the 
     documentation in 'release_notes/page_buf.txt'.
     
     We have also reduced the memory requirements for several of the 
     internal HDF library data structures, for greater efficiency. 

4. Functions added
   . Fortran interface functions added for the set external path features.
     They are hxscdir and hxsdir.  See the man page of HXsetcreatedir(3)
     and HXsetdir(3) for detail.
   . SDsetdimval_comp -- sets backward compatibility mode for a dimension.
     The default mode is compatible in HDF4.0b2, and will be 
     incompatible in HDF4.1. See the man page of SDsetdimval_comp(3)
     for detail. 
   . SDisdimval_bwcomp(dimid) -- gets the backward compatibility mode
     of a dimension. See the man page of SDisdimval_bwcomp(3) for
     detail. 

5. SGI Power Challenge running IRIX6.1 is now supported
   Power Challenge is now supported, both in the native 64-bit and the 
   32-bit objects modes.  Note that the Power Challenge native 64 bits 
   objects use 64 bits long integers, users should be careful when using 
   the netcdf interface.  They should declare their variables as "nclong", 
   not "long".

6. Pablo available  
   This version of the distribution has support to create an 
   instrumented version of the HDF library(libdf-inst.a). This 
   library along the Pablo performance data capture libraries 
   can be used to gather data about I/O behaviour and procedure 
   execution times. Please see the documentation 
   release_notes/Pablo.txt in the distribution for further details.

7. Platforms tested
    HDF4.0b2 has been tested on the following systems:
    SunOS 4.1.3, SunOS 5.3 and 5.4(Solaris 2.3 and 2.4), 
    Linux_a.out, Linux_elf, SGI/IRIX5.2, SGI/IRIX5.3,
    SGI Power Challenge/IRIX6.1 (32- and 64-bit), HP/UX 9.01,
    IBM RS6000/AIX, Cray C90, Cray YMP, DEC alpha/UNIX (OSF), 
    DecStation/MIPSEL (ncdump doesn't work), Free BSD 2.0, 
    Solaris_x86, Convex Exemplar/HPUX, and CM5 parallel I/O. 
    See the INSTALL file at the top level of HDF4.0b2 for more 
    details.

8.  Changes in release notes
    The directory release_notes/ contains writeups for the alpha
    and beta releases of HDF4.0. Those files can be used as temporary
    documents for HDF4.0 before the official documentation is 
    available. 

    Newly added: ABOUT_4.0b2, Pablo.txt, dimval.txt, and page_buf.txt
    Files changed: bug_fixed.txt and parallel_CM5.txt.
    AOUBT_4.0.alpha is also included. 

9. Fixes and Known problems

   Problems fixed:
     . To avoid conflicts with C++, internal structures' fields which
       were named 'new' have been renamed.
     . Maximum number of fields in a vdata now is decided by VSFIELDMAX.
     . Vshow and hdp are fixed. Now they can handle as many fields 
       as defined by VSFIELDMAX.
     . Fixed platform number subclass problem when external data file was
       in Little_endian format. 
     . A file hdf/src/hlimits.h has been added to hold definitions for
       maximum number of open files and other limits. 
     . Miscelianeous fixes
   
   Known problems:
     . Hfidinquire not included in binaries
     . Gzip doesn't work on 64-bit machines.
     . Currently there is a problem in appending data to compressed objects.  
     . Hfidinquire is in the source code, but it is not included in the
       pre-compiled code. If your program uses Hfidinquire, you need to
       re-compile libdf.a.

               ABOUT HDF4.0 Beta 1
                 July 25, 1995

CONTENTS

    1. New features in the HDF4.0 Beta 1 release
    2. Bugs fixed and known problems
    3. Platforms tested
    4. Installation of HDF4.0 Beta 1 on WindowsNT/95
    5. Known problems in compilation, testing and
       installation of HDF4.0b1
    6. Installing without FORTRAN support

1. New features in HDF4.0 Beta 1 release

   o Auto configuration 
     It is now possible to automatically configure and build 
     both the HDF library and netCDF library with one command. 
     See the README and the INSTALL files at the top level of 
     HDF4.0beta1 for detailed instructions on configuring and 
     installation.
     
   o Multi-file Annotation Interface (ANxxx)

     The multi-file annotation Interface is for accessing 
     file labels and descriptions, and object labels and 
     descriptions. It allows users to keep open more than 
     one file at a time, and to access more than one 
     annotation at a time.  It also allows multiple labels 
     and multiple descriptions to be applied to an HDF object 
     or HDF file. 
   
     A draft of the documentation for this interface is in 
            ./mf_anno.txt.

   o Multi-file Raster Image (GRxxx) interface
     The new Generic Raster (GR) interface provides a set of 
     functions for manipulating raster images of all kinds.  
     This interface allows users to keep open more than one 
     file at a time, and to "attach" more than one raster 
     image at a time.  It supports a general framework 
     for attributes within the RIS data-model, allowing 
     'name = value' style metadata.  It allows access to 
     subsamples and subsets of images.  HDF4.0beta1 includes
     a C interface only. The Fortran interface will be available 
     in the next release. 
 
     A draft of the documentation for this interface is in 
            ./mf_ris.txt.

   o New Compression Algorithms and interface
     A new low-level compression interface has been added to 
     HDF which allows any data-object to be compressed 
     using a variety of algorithms.  Currently only two 
     compression algorithms are supported: Run-Length 
     Encoding (RLE) and adaptive Huffman.
  
     A draft of the documentation for this interface is in 
            ./compression.txt

   o JPEG Group v5b library
     HDF Version 4.0 libraries now use v5 of the Independent 
     JPEG Group (IJG) JPEG file access library. For more details
     about JPEG library see
 
            ./JPEG_v5b.txt 

     The JPEG library will need to be linked with a user's 
     applications whether they are compressed with JPEG or not.

     For example on a SUN SPARC, if the .h files are in the 
     directory "incdir", and all libraries are in "libdir,"
     the following command should be used to compile a 
     C program "myprog.c":

     cc -DSUN -DHDF -Iincdir myprog.c libdir/libnetcdf.a \
         libdir/libdf.a  /libdir/libjpeg.a -o myprog

     or

     cc -DSUN -DHDF -Iincdir myprog.c -L libdir -lnetcdf \
         -ldf -ljpeg -o myprog

     Note that the order is important: libnetcdf.a must occur first,
     then libdf.a, and then libjpeg.a.
  
     For FORTRAN programs, use command line:

      f77 -o myprogf myprogf.f libdir/libnetcdf.a \
         libdir/libdf.a libdir/libjpeg.a

    or

      f77 -o myprogf myprogf.f -L libdir -lnetcdf -ldf -ljpeg
  
     Note that the order is important: libnetcdf.a, then libdf.a 
     and then libjpeg.a.
 
   o Compression for HDF SDS (not completely working)
     Work is almost complete on the addition of two
     new compression functions to the SD interface. 

     One function, which still has some known bugs, will 
     allow users to compress a scientific dataset using 
     any of several compression methods.  Initially two 
     schemes,  RLE encoding and an adaptive Huffman 
     compression algorithms, will be available. 

     A second function is available for storing a scientific 
     dataset using integers whose size is any number of bits 
     between 1 and 32 (instead of being restricted to 8, 16 
     or 32-bit sizes). 

     A draft of the documentation for these functions is in
            ./comp_SDS.txt


   o External Path Handling
     New functions have been added to allow applications to 
     specify directories to create or search for external 
     files. More explanation can be found in:
   
            ./external_path.txt.
 
          
   o Parallel I/O for the CM5
     An extension using the parallel I/O facilities on a  CM5 
     has been added to the SDS interface.  Initial tests have 
     resulted in about 25 MBytes/second I/O throughput using the 
     SDA (Scalable Disk Array) file system. The library 
     provides interfaces for both C* and CMF programming
     languages. See:

            ./parallel_CM5.txt for details.


   o HDF dumper
     Hdp is a command line utility designed for quick 
     display of contents and data of HDF3.3 objects, RIS, 
     SDS, Vdata, and Vgroup. It can list the contents of 
     hdf files at various levels with different details. 
     It can also dump the data of one or more specific 
     objects in the file.  See:

            ./hdp.txt for details.

     Currently hdp works on SunOS and LINUX only. 

2. Bugs fixed and known problems

  Several bugs or problems, such as failure in setting 
  and getting scales for unlimited dimensions, missing 
  Fortran version of VSQxxxx functions, failure in 
  defining more than 36 fields in Vdatas, etc. were 
  fixed in this beta release. For more details about
  fixed and un-fixed bugs and problems please see:
  
            ./bug_fixed.txt.

3. HDF4.0 Beta 1 has been tested on the following systems:
SunOS 4.1.3, SunOS 5.3 (Solaris 2.3), Linux, SGI/IRIX5.3, 
SGI Power Challenge/IRIX6.0 (32-bit mode only), HP/UX 9.01, 
IBM RS6000/AIX (C only), C3880/ConvexOS,11.0, CM5, Cray C90,
DEC alpha/OSF (C only), DecStation/MIPSEL (C only), Windows NT,
Free BSD 2.0, and Convex Exemplar/HPUX. See the INSTALL 
file at the top level of HDF4.0b1 for more details.

4. Installing HDF4.0 Beta 1 on Windows NT and Windows 95
Since Windows NT, Windows '95 (Chicago) and Windows 3.1 
(with the Win 32s extensions) all are designed to run 
the same 32-bit code, we have decided to support only 
32-bit libraries and code on the MS-Windows platform.  
To build the HDF, JPEG and netCDF libraries and utilities, 
follow the instructions listed in:

            ./install_winNT.txt. 
   
5. Known problems in compilation,testing and installation
   of HDF4.0b1:

   . On SunOS, tsdmmsf.f in hdf/test/fortest fails
   . On C90, mfhdf/fortran test doesn't configure correctly.
     The adaptive Huffman algorithm does not work right 
     either.  Due to this problem, when running 
     hdf/test/testhdf the test module comp prints out 
     error messages.  
   . On DecStation/MIPSEL, ncdump gives a segmentation fault.
   . The Fortran interface has not been tested on IBM RS6000, 
     DecStation/MIPSEL, and Dec Alpha/OSF because a Fortran 
     compiler is not available on those machines in our group.
   . If the external element test in hdf/test/testhdf fails 
     and there is no subdirectory "testdir" in hdf/test/, 
     create one via "mkdir" and run the test again. (The 
     "testdir" should have been created by "make". But 
     the "make" in some old systems does not support the 
     creation commands.)
   . A bug was found in the "mfhdf.h" file late in the testing
     stage. The error occured in the CM5 parallel I/O 
     extension only. The fix is not included in the source
     release, but it is avalable in the binary release for 
     the CM5 version.  Please retrieve the fix there. 
   . SDsetcompress does not work correctly.
   . Hdp now works on SunOS and LINUX only. Commands dumpsds, 
     dumpvd and dumpvg have different problems on other platforms.
     See mfhdf/dumper/README for more details. 

6. Installing without FORTRAN support:
   . On UNIX systems without a FORTRAN system installed, 
     the config/mh-<sys> will need to have the 'FC' macros 
     defined to "NONE" for correct configuration and the 
     target "allnofortran" should be used to build the 
     distribution, instead of the target "all".

INTRODUCTION 

This is a preliminary document describing the differences
between HDF4.0 (Alpha) and HDF3.3r3. It is written for people
who already use HDF3.3r3 or earlier versions and wish to be
HDF4.0 Alpha testers. Special emphasis is given to changes
that might be required in existing code. 

The files ABOUT_3.3r3, ABOUT_3.3r2 and ABOUT_3.3r1 which were 
released along with previous releases contain detailed
descriptions of HDF3.3. Those files can be found in this 
directory. First-time HDF users are encouraged to read the FAQ 
file in directory HDF/ for more information about HDF and where 
to get HDF documentation. 

If you have any questions or comments, please send them to:

1. Changes in include file names for FORTRAN programs

   In hdf/ there are two files for FORTRAN programs to include
   the values and functions defined in HDF. They were
   originally named as constant.i and dffunct.i. The extension .i
   causes problems on some machines since *.i is used by cc as
   an "intermediate" file produced by the cpp preprocessor. In
   HDF 4.0 dffunct.i is changed to dffunct.inc, and constant.i is
   changed to hdf.inc. Users' existing FORTRAN application
   programs need to make the corresponding changes, if they
   include the .i files, in order to compile with HDF4.0. 

2. New Features supported by HDF4.0

   ANSI C only

      As previously noted in the HDF newsletters, the next
      major release of the HDF library will compile only with
      ANSI C compilers. Backward compatibility will be
      provided through an ANSI->K&R filter which will need to
      be run on each source file in order to convert the ANSI
      style code into K&R style code. Currently the entire HDF
      library has been converted to ANSI code, but the filter
      is not yet in place. Future alpha releases may have the
      code filter in place, but it will definitely be in place
      for the first beta release. This shift to ANSI C
      compliance has been accompanied by a large cleanup in
      the source code. An attempt has been made to remove all
      warnings and informational messages that the compilers
      on supported platforms occasionally emit, but this may
      not be completely clean for all user sites. 

   n-bit SDS

      Support for n-bit integer data has been incorporated
      into this release of the HDF library. The n-bit support
      is currently incorporated into the call to
      SDsetnbitdataset, future releases may incorporate high
      level access through the DFSD interface also. Access to
      the data stored in an n-bit data item is transparent to
      the calling program. 

      For example to store an unsigned 12-bit integer (which
      is represented unpacked in memory as an unsigned 16-bit
      integer), with no sign extension or bit filling and
      which starts at bit 14 (counting from the right with bit
      zero being the lowest) the following setup & call would
      be appropriate: 

      intn sign_ext = FALSE; 

      intn fill_one = FALSE; 

      intn start_bit= 14; 

      intn bit_len = 12; 

      SDsetnbitdataset(sds_id,start_bit,bit_len,sign_ext,fill_one); 

      Further reads and writes to this dataset would
      transparently convert the 16-bit unsigned integers from
      memory into 12-bit unsigned integers stored on disk. The
      corresponding FORTRAN function name is sfsnbit which
      takes the same parameters in the same order.

      A breakdown of the parameters to the SDsetnbitdataset
      call is as follows: 

      int32 sds_id - The id of a scientific dataset returned from
      SDcreate or SDselect. intn start_bit - This value
      determines the bit position of the highest end of the
      n-bit data to write out. Bits in all number- types are
      counted from the right starting with 0. For example, in
      the following bit data, "01111011", bits 2 and 7 are set
      to 0 and all the other bits are set to one. 

      intn bit_len - The number of bits in the n-bit data to
      write, including the starting bit, counting towards the
      right (i.e. lower bit numbers). For example, starting at
      bit 5 and writing 4 bits from the following bit data,
      "01111011", would write out the bit data, "1110", to the
      dataset on disk. 

      intn sign_ext - Whether to use the top bit of the n-bit
      data to sign-extend to the highest bit in the memory
      representation of of the data. For example, if 9-bit
      signed integer data is being extracted from bits 17-25
      (nt=DFNT_INT32, start_bit=25, bit_len=9, see below for
      full information about start_bit & bit_len parameters)
      and the bit in position 25 is a 1, then when the data is
      read back in from the disk, bits 26-31 will be set to a
      1, otherwise bit 25 will be a zero and bits 26-31 will
      be set to 0. This bit-filling takes higher precendence
      (i.e. is performed after) the fill_one (see below)
      bit-filling. 

      intn fill_one - Whether to fill the "background" bits with
      1's or 0's. The "background" bits of a n-bit dataset are
      those bits in the in-memory representation which fall
      outside of the actuall n-bit field stored on disk. For
      example, if 5 bits of an unsigned 16-bit integer
      (in-memory) dataset located in bits 5-9 are written to
      disk with the fill_one parameter set to TRUE (or 1),
      then when the data is read back into memory at a future
      time, bits 0-4 and 10-15 would be set to 1. If the same
      5-bit data was written with a fill_one value of FALSE
      (or 0), then bits 0-4 and 10-15 would be set to 0. This
      setting has a lower precedence (i.e. is performed first)
      than the sign_ext setting. For example, using the
      sign_ext example above, bits 0-16 and 26-31 will first
      be set to either 1 or 0 based on the fill_one parameter,
      and then bits 26-31 will be set to 1 or 0 based on
      bit-25's value. 

   Reading CDF files

      With HDF 4.0 limited support for reading CDF files was
      added to the library. This support is still somewhat in
      the development stage and is therefore limited. 

      To begin with, unlike the netCDF merger, the CDF API is
      not supported. Rather, the SD and netCDF APIs can be
      used to access information pulled out of CDF files. 

      The type of files supported are limited to CDF 2.X
      files. The header information is different between CDF
      1.X and 2.X files. In addition, all of the files must be
      stored as single-file CDFs in network encoding. 

      If there is user demand, and support, the types of CDF
      files readable may be increased in the future. 

   Parallel I/O interface on CM5 

      An extension using the parallel IO in CM5 is added to
      the SDS interface. Initial tests have resulted in about
      25 MBytes/second IO throughput using the SDA (Scalable
      Disk Array) file system. The library provides interfaces
      for both C* and CMF programming languages. Read the
      section "Installing HDF Libraries With CM5 Parallel IO
      Extension" below for specific installation instructions.

      Users will find some examples in the directory
      mfhdf/CM5/Examples. Please send comments, bugs reports,
      etc. to acheng@ncsa.uiuc.edu. 

      The parallel I/O interface stores scientific datasets in
      external files. New options have been added to hdfls and
      hdfpack to handle them. A new utility program, hdfunpac,
      is created for external files handling too. See the man
      pages for details. 

   Installing HDF Libraries With CM5 Parallel IO Extension

      The current alpha version requires two major steps to
      install the HDF libraries (libdf.a and libnetcdf.a). Works
      are in progress to make it simpler in the production
      release. Bear with us for now. 

      1) Compile and install the ordinary HDF libraries,
      include files and utilities according to the
      instructions for a Sun Microsystem machine. 

      2) To make the HDF library with CM5 parallel IO
      extension: There are two new libraries, libdfcm5.a and
      libnetcdfcm5.a that are similar to libdf.a and
      libnetcdf.a. 

      For libdf.a 

              cd hdf
              cp MAKE.CM5 Makefile
              cp src/Makefile.CM5 src/Makefile
              make libdf          # create the parallel IO libdf.a
               # to install it in /usr/local/lib
              cp src/libdf.a /usr/local/lib/libdfcm5.a
              ranlib /usr/local/lib/libdfcm5.a
           

      For libnetcdf.a 

              cd mfhdf
              # edit CUSTOMIZE to use "gcc" as the CC compiler
              # and add "-DCM5" to the CFLAGS variable.
              ./configure
              (cd libsrc; make )      # compile the library
              # to install it in /usr/local/lib
              cp libsrc/libnetcdf.a /usr/local/lib/libnetcdfcm5.a
              ranlib /usr/local/lib/libnetcdfcm5.a
           

3. Changes in HDF utilities

   hdp -- HDF dumper 
      A new utility hdp is under development to list contents
      of HDF files and to dump data of HDF objects. A
      prototype is included in HDF4.0 Alpha for users to play
      with and comment on. Development will continue based on
      users' feedback. More information is contained in
      HDF/HDF4.0.alpha/mfhdf/dumper/README. 

   ristosds 
      Ristosds now converts several raster images into a 3D
      uint8, instead of float32, SDS. 

   hdfls 
      New options to recognize external elements. 

   hdfpack 
      New options to pack external elements back into the main
      file. 

   hdfunpac 
      New utility program to unpack scientific datasets to
      external elements. Can be used to prepare for CM5
      parallel IO access.

    * When compiling the mfhdf section of the library on a Convex3 you will
      need to set the environment variable 'MACHINE' to 'c3' before running
      the configure script.

    ** There is no FORTRAN support for either PC version of HDF4.0 Alpha

    *** The netCDF half of the HDF/netCDF merger is not working correctly,
         but the multi-file SD interface is working correctly.

5. Limits of the current release

   Sometimes it is important for HDF users to be aware of
   certain limits in using HDF files and HDF libraries. This
   section is aimed at HDF applications programmers and
   reflects upperbounds as of HDF 4.0. 

   Limits that are #define'd are fully capitalized and the
   file where the symbol is defined is given in parentheses at
   the end of the sentence. If the #define's are changed in
   order to meet the needs of an application, it is important
   to make sure that all other users, who would share the HDF
   library and the hdf files of the application, are aware of
   the changes. 

   If a limit has no #define, the size of the maximum storage
   allocated for that item is given; it would, generally,
   require a large amount of modification of the HDF library
   to change. 

   If a limit is listed as a number type (e.g. int16) then it
   refers to the largest number that can be represented using
   that type. That is: 

           int16 -- 32,767
           int32 -- 2,147,483,647.

   H-Level Limits
   --------------

      MAX_FILE files open at a single time (hfile.h) 
      MAX_ACC access records open at a single time (hfile.h) 
      int16 total tags (fixed) 
      int32 max length and offset of an element in an HDF file (fixed) 

   Vgroup Limits
   -------------
      MAX_VFILE vset files open at a single time (hdf.h)
      int16 elements in a Vgroup (fixed) 
      VGNAMELENMAX max length of a Vgroup name or class (vg.h) 

   Vdata Limits
   ------------
      MAX_VFILE vset files open at a single time (hdf.h)
      VSFIELDMAX fields in a Vdata (hdf.h) 
      FIELDNAMELENMAX characters in a single field name (hdf.h) 
      MAX_ORDER max field order in a Vdata (hdf.h) 
      VSNAMELENMAX max length of a Vdata name or class (hdf.h) 
      int16 max width in bytes of a Vdata record. (fixed) 
      Vdatas can have a maximum field width of MAX_FIELD_SIZE bytes. (hdf.h)
           
   Raster Images
   -------------
      int32 width or height of a raster image. (fixed) 

   SD Limits
   ---------
      MAX_VAR_DIMS dimensions per dataset (defined in netcdf.h
          included by mfhdf.h) 
      int32 maximum dimension length (fixed) 
      MAX_NC_ATTRS attributes for a given object (defined in netcdf.h 
          included by mfhdf.h) 
      MAX_NC_NAME maximum length of a name of a dataset 
          (defined in netcdf.h included by mfhdf.h) 

   Other Convensions / Issues
   --------------------------
      Some utility programs (e.g. ncgen) expect dataset names to be 
      composed of only alphanumeric, '-' and '_' characters.
