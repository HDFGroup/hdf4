      Install HDF4.0 release 1-patch 1 on Windows NT and Windows 95

Since Windows NT, Windows '95 (Chicago) and Windows 3.1 (with the Win 32s
extensions) all are designed to run the same 32-bit code, our decision is
to support only 32-bit libraries and code on the MS-Windows platform.
We are not planning on supporting any 16-bit versions in the foreseeable
future.

The instructions which follow assume that you will be using one of the 'zip'
files that we provide, either the complete source & binary release
(hdf40r1b.zip) or the source only release (hdf40r1s.zip).  To build the HDF,
JPEG, zlib and netCDF libraries and utilities, follow these instructions:

    1) Create a directory to unpack the library in (\HDF4.0 for example).

    2) Copy the distribution archive to that directory and unpack it using
        the appropriate archiver options to create a directory hierarchy.
        This should create a directory called 'dev' which contains several
        files and directories.

    3) Start up Visual C++ and load the 'dev.mdp' developer's project into
        the Visual C++ environment.

    4) Set the default build target to the 'hdf' sub-project and build it.

    5) Set the default build target to the 'mfhdf' sub-project and build it.
        This may require that the 'getopt' library be built first, using the
        same procedure.

    6) To test the distribution libraries, execute the following test
        applications from the development environment or a console:
            a) hdf\test\testhdf.exe
            b) mfhdf\xdr\xdrtest.exe
            c) mfhdf\libsrc\cdftest.exe
            d) mfhdf\libsrc\hdftest.exe
            e) mfhdf\nctest\nctest.exe
            
To use the HDF/JPEG/netCDF library the following locations may need to be
specified for locating header files:
    1) hdf\src
    2) hdf\jpeg
    3) hdf\zlib
    4) mfhdf\xdr
    5) mfhdf\libsrc

Remember that the netCDF part of the library needs the HDF library to perform
some I/O functions and the HDF library may need to be linked into an executable.
The JPEG & zlib libraries are called by some HDF functions also, and thus may
need to be linked to an executable also.  The libraries which may need to be
linked in are:
    1) hdf\src\src.lib
    2) hdf\jpeg\jpeg.lib
    3) hdf\zlib\zlib.lib
    4) mfhdf\libsrc\libsrc.lib
    5) mfhdf\xdr\xdr.lib
    6) mfhdf\util\getopt.lib
