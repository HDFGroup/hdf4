New features and changes
========================
    Configuration:
    -------------
    - New option for building and naming tools in CMake

      The following option has been added:
        HDF4_BUILD_STATIC_TOOLS    "Build Static Tools Not Shared Tools"          OFF

      The default will build shared tools unless BUILD_SHARED_LIBS = OFF.

    - XDR changes

      We now only support building HDF4 with the XDR implementation packaged
      with the HDF4 source, which is always built with the mfhdf library.

      The following options have been removed:

        Autotools:  --enable-hdf4-xdr
        CMake:      HDF4_BUILD_XDR_LIB

      The following header files are no longer deployed:

        types.h, xdr.h

      The XDR functionality has been incorporated into the mfhdf library,
      so a separate XDR library is no longer distributed with either build
      system.

    - Man pages were removed

      The few man pages in the HDF4 library are woefully incomplete and/or
      outdated.  We have no resources to properly update those and to add the
      missing ones. Instead, we will try to create better man pages from Doxygen.

    - Incorporated HDF4 examples repository into HDF4 library.

      The HDF4Examples folder is equivalent to the repository hdf4-examples.
      As such it can build and test the examples during library build or after
      the library is installed. Previously, the hdf4-repository archives were
      downloaded for packaging with the library. Now the examples can be built
      and tested without a packaged install of the library.

      However to maintain the ability to use the HDF4Examples with an installed
      library, it is necessary to translate or synch the option names from those
      used by the library to those used by the examples. The typical pattern is:
            <example option> = <library option>
            HDF_BUILD_JAVA = ${HDF4_BUILD_JAVA}

    - Autotools and CMake target added to produce doxygen generated documentation

      The default is OFF or disabled.
      Autoconf option is '--enable-doxygen'
        autotools make target is 'doxygen' and will build all doxygen targets
      CMake configure option is 'HDF4_BUILD_DOC'.
        CMake target is 'doxygen' for all available doxygen targets
        CMake target is 'hdf4lib_doc' for the src subdirectory

    - Added support for CMake presets file.

      CMake supports two main files, CMakePresets.json and CMakeUserPresets.json,
      that allow users to specify common configure options and share them with others.
      HDF added a CMakePresets.json file of a typical configuration and support
      file, config/cmake-presets/hidden-presets.json. 
      Also added a section to INSTALL_CMake.txt with very basic explanation of the
      process to use CMakePresets.

    - Private headers are no longer deployed

      * dfi.h - Declared private, unused, undocumented in UG/RM/DG, has been
                removed from the library entirely.

    - Dropped support for MacFS I/O

      MacFS was an obscure I/O system from the late 90s used to access HFS
      volumes on MacOS 9 and earlier (publication CMU-CS-98-145 can be
      found via an internet search).

      HDF4 allows a library builder to manually specify the FILELIB symbol
      found in hdfi.h to use C standard library buffered I/O (fopen, etc.),
      POSIX unbuffered I/O (open, etc.), or MacFS I/O (mopen, etc.). The
      library default is to use C buffered I/O and there is no obvious
      build-time or run-time option to change that. The FILELIB value is
      then used to map HI_OPEN, etc. to appropriate I/O calls.

      The "alternative" I/O schemes (POSIX unbuffered and MacFS) are not
      tested. Due to its age and obscurity, MacFS support is being dropped.
      The POSIX unbuffered I/O scheme will remain in place for now since it
      might be interesting to profile that vs C stdio.h calls.

      This change will have *NO IMPACT* on modern Macs. Files created using
      MacFS in the 90s and early 2000s can be accessed using C standard
      library I/O.

    C Library:
    ----------
    - Private headers are no longer deployed

      The following private headers are not a part of the public API and
      will no longer be deployed when installing the library:
      
        atom.h
        bitvect.h
        cdeflate.h
        cnbit.h
        cnone.h
        crle.h
        cskphuff.h
        cszip.h
        df.h
        dfan.h
        dfgr.h
        dfrig.h
        dfsd.h
        dfufp2i.h
        dynarray.h
        hchunks.h
        hcompi.h
        hconv.h
        hdfi.h
        hfile.h
        hkit.h
        linklist.h
        local_nc.h
        mfan.h
        mfani.h
        mfgri.h
        mstdio.h
        tbbt.h

    - hdfi.h is no longer included by hdf.h

      In the past, hdfi.h (an internal header file) was included in the
      public hdf.h header. This is no longer the case. Anything that
      should be public has been moved from hdfi.h to hdf.h, including:

        * The C99-like types (e.g., float32)
        * The archaic VOID/VOIDP macros
        * The intf Fortran integer type
        * The HD library macros (e.g., HDmalloc)

      All of these things are considered obsolete and we only maintain
      them in the public header so that old code does not have to be
      modified. It is unwise to use them in new code.

      NOTE: hdfi.h included many POSIX, Windows, and C standard library
            headers.

        *** THESE WILL NO LONGER BE BROUGHT IN BY INCLUDING HDF.H!!! ***

            If you have been relying on hdf.h to bring in headers like
            stdlib.h, windows.h, or unistd.h, you will need to update your
            code when you move to HDF 4.3.0.


Support for new platforms and compilers
=======================================


Bugs fixed since HDF 4.2.16
===========================

    - Fix --with-szlib with no paths not detecting the encoder

      The --with-szlib option in the Autotools has been broken when used
      without include/library paths for the past decade (git blame says 11
      years ago). A misnamed variable and a missing setting would skip
      the encoder check, so the library could only be added in decode-only
      mode.

      This has been fixed and szip encoding will now be detected normally.

    - Fixed an external file bug introduced in 4.2.16

      Fixing HDFFR-1607 introduced a bug where the flag that indicates whether
      the external file directory has been changed from the previous location
      was not reset properly.
      Reset the flag after building a filename path for an external element.

      Fixes HDFFR-1609

    - Build fortran with -fallow-argument-mismatch w/ gcc 10+

      The gfortran configuration checks checked the version via a variable that
      was never set, preventing -fallow-argument-mismatch from being set w/
      gcc 10+, which would prevent building the fortran interface.

      Fixes HDFFR-1582

    - JNI SDSreaddata functions for float and double used mismatched buffer macros

      The SDreaddata_double and SDreaddata_float function created data buffers with
      PIN_DOUBLE_ARRAY_CRITICAL and PIN_FLOAT_ARRAY_CRITICAL macros then tried to
      free the buffers with UNPIN_DOUBLE_ARRAY and UNPIN_FLOAT_ARRAY macros. This caused
      free() call to use an invalid pointer.

      Change the macros PIN_DOUBLE_ARRAY_CRITICAL to PIN_DOUBLE_ARRAY and
      PIN_FLOAT_ARRAY_CRITICAL to PIN_DOUBLE_ARRAY.

Known problems
==============
o  The Fortran interface does not work on 64-bit systems as it stores addresses
   in memory as Fortran INTEGER values, which are typically 32-bit. The
   Fortran interface is currently disabled by default due to this. It should
   only be enabled on 32-bit systems.

o  Builds with the autotools option --enable-hdf4-xdr fail on Solaris and
   on IBM ppc64 with the xlc compiler.  The option should not be used on
   those platforms.

o  A number of tools and tests fail to free small amounts of memory if they
   are just going to exit anyway.  This doesn't appear to be a memory leak
   in the core library.  We're planning to fix these leaks in future releases,
   likely by modifying these tools to have a single point of return, where
   resource cleanup will be carried out. 

o  CMake files do not behave correctly with paths containing spaces.
   Do not use spaces in paths because the required escaping for handling spaces
   results in very complex and fragile build files.
   ADB - 2019/05/07

o  Several Fortran examples print "^@" when displaying strings (for example,
   names of the attributes). This happens because Fortran application
   doesn't know the length of the strings passed from the C library.
   EIP - 2015-01-11, HDFFR-1477

o  CMake fails to set the full path to the install location on Windows:
    The configuration file for examples, HDF4_Examples.cmake, must be updated
    with the correct value by editing the file or using the INSTALLDIR option.
    This issue is because of spaces in the path.
   ADB - 2014/02/03

o  CMake "make install" fails installing the tools:
    Use CPack to create an install package.
   ADB - 2014/02/03

o  CMake does not install these man pages:
    hdf.1, ncdump.1, ncgen.1
   AKC/BMR - 2014/02/02

o  On IBM PowerPC 64, hdftest fails when gcc 4.4.6 is used with -O3 optimization
   level.

o  When building on Linux/UNIX platforms, the szip shared library files must
   be in the system library path.  This can be done by adding a link to
   the libsz.* files in the /usr/lib folder or by adding the library
   location to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
      Ex. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path_to_szip_lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   Optionally, one can use the static szip library files by adding '-static'
   to the CFLAGS environment variable.

o  Existing data written by an HDF4 Library prior to HDF 4.2r2:
   When a one-dimensional SDS and a dimension scale have
   the same name, subsequent accesses to the dimension scale or to the
   SDS might produce undesired results because the libraries could not
   distinguish between the two objects.  In the case of writing, data
   might even be corrupted.  For example, SDS data might be written to a
   dimension variable or vice versa. (bugzilla #624)

   HDF4 Library Releases 4.2r2 and later make a distinction between an SDS
   and a dimension variable.  However, as with older versions, these recent
   versions are unable to detect such conflicts in files created by earlier
   releases.  It is therefore STRONGLY recommended to check for such name
   duplication before working with data created with a pre-4.2r2 library.

   The functions SDgetnumvars_byname and SDnametoindices are provided
   to help detect such name conflicts and select the correct object to
   access, respectively; see the HDF Reference Manual entries for
   further details.
   FB - 2009/01/26
   BMR - revised 2011/06/24

o  N-bit compression is not supported with Fortran APIs.

o  Using both fill-value and compression on SD datasets does not work.

o  When using PGI compilers, make sure that the JPEG library is also compiled
   with a PGI C compiler; linking with a JPEG library built with gcc causes
   JPEG library tests to fail.  To bypass the problem:

       x Set LIBS flag to $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a
         where $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR points to the installation directory
         for the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         setenv LIBS $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a

       x Use the --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR configure flag to
         configure with the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         ./configure --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR --with-zlib....

o  In order for the API SDgetdatasize to get the correct compressed size
   of the data, the dataset needs to be closed (SDendaccess) or read
   (SDreaddata) after being written and before SDgetdatasize is called.
