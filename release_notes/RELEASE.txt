HDF version 4.2.11-pre2 currently under development
====================================================

INTRODUCTION

This document describes the differences between HDF 4.2.10 and HDF 4.2.11-pre2.
It is written for people who are familiar with previous releases of HDF 
and wish to migrate to HDF 4.2.11-pre2.

The HDF 4.2.10 documentation can be found on the The HDF Group's website
at:
    http://www.hdfgroup.org/release4/doc/

Previous versions of the documentation are available from the FTP server:

Bugs fixed since HDF 4.2.10
=========================
   Configuration
   =============
    - Windows installer incorrect display of PATH environment variable.
    
      In the Windows installer, the dialog box where the user can elect to
      add the product's bin path to the %PATH% environment variable displayed
      an incorrect path. This path was missing the C:\Program Files part
      and used the POSIX file separator '/' before the bin (<path>/bin,
      instead of <path>\bin).
      
      The dialog box text was changed to simply say that the product's bin
      path would be added instead of explicitly displaying the path.
      This is in line with most installers. The reason for not fixing the 
      displayed path instead is that it is difficult to pass the correct
      path from CPack to the NSIS installer for display.

      Note that this was never a code issue - it was just a display
      problem. The installer always did the right thing when updating the
      environment variable.

   Library
   ========= 
    - Warning "array subscript is below array bounds"

      Applied user's patch to remove the warning.

      (BMR 2014/06/02, HDFFR-1379)


   Utilities
   ========= 
    - Detection of read failure in ncdump

      Previously, ncdump did not detect failure from ncvarget because the
      returned value from ncvarget was not checked, and the calling function
      simply returned 0.

      The error code ERR_READFAIL (-2) is added to ncdump only to indicate this
      failure within ncdump, which will display this message:

      "Reading failed for variable <Variable name>, the data is possibly corrupted."

      (BMR 2015/01/21, HDFFR-1468)

    - Improvement of the ncgen's usage statement.

      Previously, ncgen's usage looked like this:
      ncgen: -: Usage: ncgen [-V] [ -b ] [ -c ] [ -f ] [ -o outfile]  [ file... ]

      More details are added to the usage to improve clarity.  Now, it is more
      clear, and consistent with ncdump, like this:
      Usage: ncgen [-V] [ -b ] [ -c ] [ -f ] [ -o outfile] [ file ... ]
        [-V]             Display version of the HDF4 library and exit
        [-b]             For binary netCDF output, '.nc' extension
        [-c]             For C output
        [-f]             For Fortran output
        [-o <outfile>]   Explicitly specify output file name

      (BMR 2015/01/19, HDFFR-1459)

    - Output of hrepack containing an unnecessary vgroup of class RIG0.0

      When the input file did not have any GR elements, hrepack still opened and
      closed the output file using the GR API, which caused the RIG0.0 vgroup to
      be written to the output file.

      Hrepack now skips accessing the output file using GR API, when the input
      file doesn't have any images and any GR attributes.

      (BMR 2015/01/18, HDFFR-1428)

    - Compliance with Fedora standard regarding printf/fprintf statements

      Users sent patches for the problem where the format string is missing from
      the printf/fprintf statements.  This is in compliance with Fedora standard.
      For more information, see
		https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Format-Security-FAQ.

      In the context where this problem occurred, the benefit of using puts/fputs
      over printf/fprintf is insignificant.  Thus, the fix was adding "%s" to
      those printf/fprintf statements that don't have the format string instead
      of switching to puts/fputs.

      (BMR 2014/12/16, HDFFR-1423 and HDFFR-1475)

    - Failure of hdp on some hdfeos generated files

      Attribute vdatas created by hdfeos API have the field named "AttrValues".
      The utility functions Vattrhdfsize and VSattrhdfsize, in hdp.c, used
      ATTR_FIELD_NAME ("VALUES") to verify that a vdata is storing an attribute,
      causing failure on some hdfeos generated files.  In addition, when this
      failure occurred, the calling function tried to free allocated resources
      prematurely.

      The check against ATTR_FIELD_NAME and the premature resource deallocation
      are removed.

      (BMR 2014/12/08, HDFFR-1471)

    - nclong versus long in tests

      Applied the user's patch to remove a test failure.

      (BMR 2014/10/21, HDFFR-1378)


Documentation
=============
    - Updated Reference Manual and User's Guide

      The documents were updated to contain information of the changes to
      the tools.  In addition, various improvements were applied.

Known problems
==============
o  Several Fortran examples print "^@" when displaying strings (for example,
   names of the attributes). This happens because Fortran application 
   doesn't know the length of the strings passed from the C library.  
   EIP - 2015-01-11, HDFFR-1477

o  CMake builds in Windows uses the same pre-generated ncgen*.[ch] files from
   the yacc/lex input files. The generated file, ncgenyy.c, uses the <unistd.h>
   header file that Windows does not support.  This must be blocked out in
   order for Windows to use it. 
   AKC 2014-02-03, HDFFR-1424

o  CMake "make install" fails installing the tools:
    Use CPack to create an install package.
   ADB - 2014/02/03

o  CMake does not install these man pages:
	hdf.1, ncdump.1, ncgen.1
   AKC/BMR - 2014/02/02

o  For Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and on 10.8 Mountain Lion, several tests fail with
   GCC, Intel and Clang compilers.  Currently, this situation is detected and
   -O0 level optimization is used.  
   (HDFFR-1318,1358) EIP - 2013/02/05

o  On IBM PowerPC 64, hdftest fails when gcc 4.4.6 is used with -O3 optimization 
   level. 

o  When building in AIX systems, if CC is xlc with -qlanglvl=ansi, configure
   will fail when checking for the jpeglib.h header due to the duplicated
   macro definition of HAVE_STDLIB_H.  This is because some newer builds
   of the jpeg library have HAVE_STDLIB_H defined in the jconfig.h header file.
   Without the -qlanglvl=ansi, some older xlc versions (e.g., V7.0) still 
   fail, but newer xlc versions (e.g., V9.0) pass.  AKC - 2010/02/17

o  When building on Linux/UNIX platforms, the szip shared library files must
   be in the system library path.  This can be done by adding a link to
   the libsz.* files in the /usr/lib folder or by adding the library
   location to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
      Ex. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path_to_szip_lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   Optionally, one can use the static szip library files by adding '-static'
   to the CFLAGS environment variable.
   
o  Existing data written by an HDF4 Library prior to HDF 4.2r2:
   When a one-dimensional SDS and a dimension scale have
   the same name, subsequent accesses to the dimension scale or to the
   SDS might produce undesired results because the libraries could not
   distinguish between the two objects.  In the case of writing, data
   might even be corrupted.  For example, SDS data might be written to a
   dimension variable or vice versa. (bugzilla #624)

   HDF4 Library Releases 4.2r2 and later make a distinction between an SDS
   and a dimension variable.  However, as with older versions, these recent
   versions are unable to detect such conflicts in files created by earlier 
   releases.  It is therefore STRONGLY recommended to check for such name 
   duplication before working with data created with a pre-4.2r2 library.

   The functions SDgetnumvars_byname and SDnametoindices are provided
   to help detect such name conflicts and select the correct object to
   access, respectively; see the HDF Reference Manual entries for
   further details.
   FB - 2009/01/26
   BMR - revised 2011/06/24

o  N-bit compression is not supported with Fortran APIs.

o  Using both fill-value and compression on SD datasets does not work.

o  When using PGI compilers, make sure that the JPEG library is also compiled 
   with a PGI C compiler; linking with a JPEG library built with gcc causes 
   JPEG library tests to fail.  To bypass the problem:

       x Set LIBS flag to $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a
         where $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR points to the installation directory
         for the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         setenv LIBS $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a

       x Use the --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR configure flag to 
         configure with the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         ./configure --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR --with-zlib....

o  In order for the API SDgetdatasize to get the correct compressed size
   of the data, the dataset needs to be closed (SDendaccess) or read
   (SDreaddata) after being written and before SDgetdatasize is called.
