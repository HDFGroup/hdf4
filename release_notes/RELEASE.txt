New features and changes
========================
    Configuration:
    -------------
    - Dropped support for many obsolete platforms

      HDF4 uses pre-defined machine configurations instead of configure tests
      to include header files, set up typedefs, etc. In the future, the
      library will be adapted to use a flexible configure test scheme like
      HDF5, but in the meantime we will simplify the machine configuration
      header by dropping configurations for the following platforms:

        - Irix / MIPS
        - Itanium
        - Intel i860
        - Fujitsu VP
        - Convex
        - "K&R Sun" and Solaris on x86
        - DEC Alpha
        - Apollo
        - HP-UX / HP-9000
        - Motorola m88k

      In addition, many #defines have been updated to reflect modern usage,
      particularly on Windows and MacOS.

      (DER - 2023/01/13)

    - Added new option to build jpeg, libaec and zlib inline with CMake.

      Using the CMake FetchContent module, the external filters can populate
      content at configure time via any method supported by the ExternalProject
      module. Whereas ExternalProject_Add() downloads at build time, the
      FetchContent module makes content available immediately, allowing the
      configure step to use the content in commands like add_subdirectory(),
      include() or file() operations.

      The HDF options (and defaults) for using this are:
          BUILD_JPEG_WITH_FETCHCONTENT:BOOL=OFF
          JPEG_USE_LOCALCONTENT:BOOL=OFF
          BUILD_SZIP_WITH_FETCHCONTENT:BOOL=OFF
          LIBAEC_USE_LOCALCONTENT:BOOL=OFF
          BUILD_ZLIB_WITH_FETCHCONTENT:BOOL=OFF
          ZLIB_USE_LOCALCONTENT:BOOL=OFF

      The CMake variables to control the path and file names:
          JPEG_TGZ_ORIGPATH:STRING
          JPEG_TGZ_ORIGNAME:STRING
          LIBAEC_TGZ_ORIGPATH:STRING
          LIBAEC_TGZ_ORIGNAME:STRING
          ZLIB_TGZ_ORIGPATH:STRING
          ZLIB_TGZ_ORIGNAME:STRING

      See the CMakeFilters.cmake and config/cmake/cacheinit.cmake files for usage.

      (ADB - 2023/01/13)

    - Removed all references to C++

      HDF4 does not have a C++ wrapper and, like HDF5, we do not support
      building the library with a C++ compiler since the languages are
      diverging.

      Despite this, some parts of the build system checked for a C++ compiler,
      manipulated CXXFLAGS, etc. This was mainly in files that were brought
      over from HDF5. This build system code has been removed.

      As a part of this C++ cleanup, the extern "C" ifdefs in the header files
      no longer test for c_plusplus.

      (DER - 2023/01/13)

    - The Fortran interface is disabled by default

      The Fortran interface is unsafe on 32-bit systems as it stores pointers
      in 32-bit integers. It will be removed in a future release, but for now
      it will be disabled by default in both CMake and the Autotools.

      (DER - 2023/01/12)

    - Corrected path searched by CMake find_package command

      The install path for cmake find_package files had been changed to use
        "share/cmake"
      on all platforms. However, the trailing "hdf4" directory was not removed
      at that time. This "hdf4" additional directory has been removed from all
      the install paths.

      (ADB - 2021/09/27)

    - Corrected pkg-config compile script

      It was discovered that the position of the "$@" argument for the command
      in the compile script may fail on some platforms and configurations. The
      position of the "$@"command argument was moved to a position before the
      pkg-config sub command.

      (ADB - 2021/08/30)

    - CMake option to use AEC (open source SZip) library instead of SZip

      The open source AEC library is a replacement library for SZip. In
      order to use it for hdf5 the libaec CMake source was changed to add
      "-fPIC" and exclude test files. Autotools does not build the
      compression libraries within hdf5 builds. New option USE_LIBAEC is
      required to compensate for the different files produced by AEC build.

Known problems
==============
o  Builds with the autotools option --enable-hdf4-xdr fail on Solaris and
   on IBM ppc64 with the xlc compiler.  The option should not be used on
   those platforms.

o  CMake files do not behave correctly with paths containing spaces.
   Do not use spaces in paths because the required escaping for handling spaces
   results in very complex and fragile build files.
   ADB - 2019/05/07

o  Several Fortran examples print "^@" when displaying strings (for example,
   names of the attributes). This happens because Fortran application
   doesn't know the length of the strings passed from the C library.
   EIP - 2015-01-11, HDFFR-1477

o  CMake fails to set the full path to the install location on Windows:
    The configuration file for examples, HDF4_Examples.cmake, must be updated
    with the correct value by editing the file or using the INSTALLDIR option.
    This issue is because of spaces in the path.
   ADB - 2014/02/03

o  CMake "make install" fails installing the tools:
    Use CPack to create an install package.
   ADB - 2014/02/03

o  CMake does not install these man pages:
    hdf.1, ncdump.1, ncgen.1
   AKC/BMR - 2014/02/02

o  For Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, 10.8 Mountain Lion, 10.9 Mavericks, 10.10 Yosemite,
   and 10.11 El Capitan, when compiling with -O2, some xdr functions might cause
   memory corruption.  This happened for GCC, Intel and Clang compilers.
   Currently, -O0 level optimization is used to avoid this problem.
   (HDFFR-1318,1327,1358,1425) EIP - 2013/02/05, BMR - 2016/06/24
   Update: This issue has been addressed in 4.2.15. BMR - 2020/02/24

o  On IBM PowerPC 64, hdftest fails when gcc 4.4.6 is used with -O3 optimization
   level.

o  When building in AIX systems, if CC is xlc with -qlanglvl=ansi, configure
   will fail when checking for the jpeglib.h header due to the duplicated
   macro definition of HAVE_STDLIB_H.  This is because some newer builds
   of the jpeg library have HAVE_STDLIB_H defined in the jconfig.h header file.
   Without the -qlanglvl=ansi, some older xlc versions (e.g., V7.0) still
   fail, but newer xlc versions (e.g., V9.0) pass.  AKC - 2010/02/17

o  When building on Linux/UNIX platforms, the szip shared library files must
   be in the system library path.  This can be done by adding a link to
   the libsz.* files in the /usr/lib folder or by adding the library
   location to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
      Ex. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path_to_szip_lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   Optionally, one can use the static szip library files by adding '-static'
   to the CFLAGS environment variable.

o  Existing data written by an HDF4 Library prior to HDF 4.2r2:
   When a one-dimensional SDS and a dimension scale have
   the same name, subsequent accesses to the dimension scale or to the
   SDS might produce undesired results because the libraries could not
   distinguish between the two objects.  In the case of writing, data
   might even be corrupted.  For example, SDS data might be written to a
   dimension variable or vice versa. (bugzilla #624)

   HDF4 Library Releases 4.2r2 and later make a distinction between an SDS
   and a dimension variable.  However, as with older versions, these recent
   versions are unable to detect such conflicts in files created by earlier
   releases.  It is therefore STRONGLY recommended to check for such name
   duplication before working with data created with a pre-4.2r2 library.

   The functions SDgetnumvars_byname and SDnametoindices are provided
   to help detect such name conflicts and select the correct object to
   access, respectively; see the HDF Reference Manual entries for
   further details.
   FB - 2009/01/26
   BMR - revised 2011/06/24

o  N-bit compression is not supported with Fortran APIs.

o  Using both fill-value and compression on SD datasets does not work.

o  When using PGI compilers, make sure that the JPEG library is also compiled
   with a PGI C compiler; linking with a JPEG library built with gcc causes
   JPEG library tests to fail.  To bypass the problem:

       x Set LIBS flag to $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a
         where $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR points to the installation directory
         for the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         setenv LIBS $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a

       x Use the --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR configure flag to
         configure with the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         ./configure --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR --with-zlib....

o  In order for the API SDgetdatasize to get the correct compressed size
   of the data, the dataset needs to be closed (SDendaccess) or read
   (SDreaddata) after being written and before SDgetdatasize is called.
