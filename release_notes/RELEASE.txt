HDF version 4.2.7 released on 2012-02-06
===================================================

INTRODUCTION

This document describes the differences between HDF 4.2.6 and HDF 4.2.7.
It is written for people who are familiar with previous releases of HDF 
and wish to migrate to HDF 4.2.7.

The HDF 4.2.7 documentation can be found on the The HDF Group's FTP server:

    ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF/Documentation/

First-time HDF users are encouraged to read the HDF FAQ, which can be
reached from the HDF product home page:

New features and changes
========================
   Source distribution
   ===================
   - None


   Configuration
   ============= 
   - Fortran fort_ps folders are now obsolete, and VS2008 project
     files have been updated.
     CMake was tested on Windows, Linux, and Cygwin.
     ADB - 2012/1/20
     
   Library
   ========= 
   - Fortran fort_ps folders are obsolete and have been removed.
     ADB - 2012/1/20
   - VSgetexternalfile and SDgetexternalfile are superseded by VSgetexternalinfo
     and SDgetexternalinfo because their prototypes missed the parameter
     "length" for external data length.  (part 1 in bug HDFFR-1297)
     BMR - 2012/1/15
   - Visinternal is superseded by Vgisinternal, which allows the handling of
     special cases in old data.  (part 2 in bug HDFFR-1297)
     BMR - 2012/1/15
   - Fortran wrappers vfgvgroups and vsfgvdatas have been added for 
     Vgetvgroups and VSgetvdatas, respectively.
     MSB - 2012/1/5

   Test
   ====
   - The following files were added:
     ./hdf/test/test_files/README: special notes on data files in this directory
     ./hdf/test/test_files/grtdfui83.hdf: file to test old data situations
     ./mfhdf/test/tutils.c: added to provide common code for various tests
     BMR - 2011/1/21

   - The following file was removed:
     ./mfhdf/test/tidtypes.c: changed to tmixed_apis.c for broader contents
     BMR - 2011/1/21

   Utilities
   ========= 
   - The following files were added:
     ./mfhdf/dumper/testfiles/Roy.nc: file to test skipping compression check
      in a netCDF file
     ./mfhdf/dumper/testfiles/dumpsds-18.out: output of testing netCDF file
     ./hdf/test/tvnameclass.c: tests issues involving vgroup/vdata names/classes
     BMR - 2011/1/21


Support for new platforms and compilers
=======================================
   -  IBM XL Fortran for Linux 64-bit, V13.1 on Linux PowerPC 64
      EIP - 2012-02-01

Bugs fixed since HDF4.2.6
=========================
   Utilities
   ========= 
   - hrepack: Version HDF4 2.6 does not allow the combination of unlimited 
     dimensions and compression, which is wrong. 
   - Freeing incorrect buffers caused segfault.  It was previously commented
     out, thus resulted in memory leaks.  This is now fixed.  (HDFFR-479)
     BMR - 2011/11/3
   - hdp: fixed to skip netCDF files when checking for compression.  (HDFFR-473)
     BMR - 2011/11/1


   Library
   ========= 
   - SDgetchunkinfo and SDreadchunk failed on an empty SDS when the file is
     opened as read-only (HDFFR-171).  This is now fixed.
     BMR - 2011/10/20
   - SDcheckempty was fixed to return "empty" when detecting a pair of
     DFTAG_SD/<valid ref> that is associated with offset=INVALID_OFFSET and
     length=INVALID_LENGTH.
     BMR - 2011/10/9
   - Vgetclass and Vgetname were fixed to return vgclass and vgname with null
     terminated character when the class or name is not set. (HDFFR-1288)
     BMR - 2011/9/19


   Configuration
   =============
   - configure.ac: compilers with paths or names containing '-' were added to
     CFLAGS.  This issue was caused by a change in revision 5647, introduced
     in version 4.2.6.  This issue (HDFFR-1310) is fixed in version 4.2.7-patch1 
     by reverting the r 5647 change to configure.ac and configure that moved 
     any flags in CC and F77 to CFLAGS and FFLAGS.  


Documentation
==============
   - The Reference Manual and User's Guide have been updated to include 
     new functions:
     + VSgetexternalinfo and SDgetexternalinfo
     + Vgisinternal
     + Fortran wrappers vfgvgroups and vsfgvdatas
     BMR - 2012/1/22

Known problems
==============

o  On IBM PowerPC 64 hdftest fails when gcc 4.4.6 is used with -O3 optimization level. 

o  When building in AIX systems, if CC is xlc with -qlanglvl=ansi, configure
   fails when checking for the jpeglib.h header due to the duplicated
   macro definition of HAVE_STDLIB_H.  This is because some newer builds
   of jpeg library have HAVE_STDLIB_H defined in the jconfig.h header file.
   Without the -qlanglvl=ansi, some older xlc (e.g., V7.0) still fails but
   newer xlc (e.g., V9.0) passes.  AKC - 2010/02/17

o  When building on Linux/UNIX platforms, the szip shared library files must
   be in the system library path. This can be done by adding a link to
   the libsz.* files in the /usr/lib folder or by adding the library
   location to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
      Ex. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=path_to_szip_lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   Optionally, one can use the static szip library files by adding '-static'
   to the CFLAGS environment variable.
   
o  Existing data written by an HDF4 Library prior to HDF 4.2r2:
   When a one-dimensional SDS and a dimension scale have
   the same name, subsequent accesses to the dimension scale or to the
   SDS might produce undesired results because the libraries could not
   distinguish between the two objects.  In the case of writing, data
   might even be corrupted.  For example, SDS data might be written to a
   dimension variable or vice versa.

   HDF4 Library Releases 4.2r2 and later make a distinction between an SDS
   and a dimension variable.  However, as with older versions, these recent
   versions are unable to detect such conflicts in files created by earlier 
   releases.  It is therefore STRONGLY recommended to check for such name 
   duplication before working with data created with a pre-4.2r2 library.

   The functions SDgetnumvars_byname and SDnametoindices are provided
   to help detect such name conflicts and select the correct object to
   access, respectively; see the HDF Reference Manual entries for
   further details.

o  This release does not support VMS systems.

o  N-bit compression is not supported with Fortran APIs.

o  Using both fill-value and compression on SD datasets does not work.

o  When using PGI compilers, make sure that the JPEG library is also compiled 
   with a PGI C compiler; linking with a JPEG library built with gcc causes 
   JPEG library tests to fail.  To bypass the problem:

       x Set LIBS flag to $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a
         where $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR points to the installation directory
         for the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         setenv LIBS $PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR/lib/libjpeg.a

       x Use the --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR configure flag to 
         configure with the PGI-compiled JPEG library:

         ./configure --with-jpeg=$PGI_JPEG_INSTALL_DIR --with-zlib....

o  In order for the API SDgetdatasize to get the correct compressed size
   of the data, the dataset needs to be closed (SDendaccess) or read
   (SDreaddata) after being written and before SDgetdatasize is called.
