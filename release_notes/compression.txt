Compression Algorithms and interface

    The low-level compression interface allows any data object to be 
compressed using a variety of algorithms.  This is completely transparent 
to users once the data has been compressed initially - further data written
to an object or read from it are compressed or decompressed internally to
the library, without user intervention.  Currently only three compression
algorithms are supported: Run-Length Encoding (RLE), adaptive Huffman,
and an LZ-77 dictionary coder (the gzip 'deflation' algorithm).
Plans for future algorithms include an Lempel/Ziv-78 dictionary coding,
an arithmetic coder and a faster Huffman algorithm.
    The public interface for this routine is contained in the user-level
function call, HCcreate.  The interface to HCcreate is described below:

int32 HCcreate(id,tag,ref,model_type,m_info,coder_type,c_info);
    int32 id;                IN: the file id to create the data in (from Hopen)
    uint16 tag,ref;          IN: the tag/ref pair of the data object which
                                    is to be compressed
    comp_model_t model_type; IN: the type of modeling to use, currently
                                    only COMP_MODEL_STDIO is supported, which
                                    indicates data is transferred in the
                                    same way as C I/O functions operate.
    model_info *m_info;      IN: Information needed for the modeling type chosen
                                    Nothing needed for COMP_MODEL_STDIO,
                                    so NULL can be used.
    comp_coder_t coder_type; IN: the type of encoding to use from the following:
                                    COMP_CODE_NONE - for no compression
                                    COMP_CODE_RLE - for RLE encoding
                                    COMP_CODE_SKPHUFF - for adaptive Huffman
                                    COMP_CODE_DEFLATE - for gzip 'deflation'
    coder_info *c_info;      IN: Information needed for the encoding type chosen
                                    For COMP_CODE_NONE and COMP_CODE_RLE,
                                    this is unused and can be set to NULL.
                                    For COMP_CODE_SKPHUFF, the structure skphuff
                                    in this union needs information about the
                                    size of the data elements in bytes (see
                                    examples below).
                                    For COMP_CODE_DEFLATE, the structure deflate
                                    in this union needs information about the
                                    "effort" to encode data with.  Higher
                                    values of 'level' member indicate more
                                    compression effort.  Values may range from
                                    0 (minimal compression, fastest time) to
                                    9 (maximum compression, slowest time).
    RETURNS
        Return an AID to the newly created compressed element, FAIL on error.

    HCcreate will compress an existing data object with the specified 
compression method, or it can create a new data object which will contain
compressed data when it is written to.  In either case, Hendaccess must be
called to release the AID allocated by HCcreate.  In the first two examples
below the datasets already exist, in the final example the dataset is created
by the HCcreate call.  There is currently no FORTRAN equivalent for this
function.  More details about this function can be found in the HDF reference
manual.

The following example shows how to compress a scientific dataset data object
(which is composed of multi-dimensional 32-bit integer data) using the
adaptive Huffman encoding:
    {
        int32 aid;
        coder_info c_info;

        c_info.skphuff.skp_size=sizeof(int32);
        aid=HCcreate(file_id, DFTAG_SD, ref, COMP_MODEL_STDIO, NULL, 
            COMP_CODE_SKPHUFF,&c_info);
        .
        .
        <access data object>
        .
        .
        Hendaccess(aid);
    }

The following example shows show to compress a raster image data object
using the RLE algorithm:
    {
        int32 aid;

        aid=HCcreate(file_id, DFTAG_RI, ref, COMP_MODEL_STDIO, NULL, 
            COMP_CODE_RLE,NULL);
        .
        .
        <access data object>
        .
        .
        Hendaccess(aid);
    }

The following example shows how to create a new data object whose data
will compressed as it is written:
    {
        int32 aid;

        aid=HCcreate(file_id, DFTAG_RI, ref, COMP_MODEL_STDIO, NULL, 
            COMP_CODE_RLE,NULL);
        .
        .
        Hwrite(aid,len,data);
        .
        .
        Hendaccess(aid);
    }
