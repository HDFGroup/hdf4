We now recommend that users build, test and install HDF4 using CMake.

Instructions for building and testing HDF4 using CMake can be found in the
INSTALL_CMake.txt file found in this folder.

For instructions of building and testing an application with HDF4, see
USING_HDF4_CMake.txt file found in this folder.

Users who want to build and run an application with HDF4 in Visual Studio
without using CMake should consult the USING_HDF4_VS.txt file. Building
applications with the dynamic/shared hdf4 libraries requires that the
"H4_BUILT_AS_DYNAMIC_LIB" compile definition be used.

Additional Third-party Software Requirements:

   1)  Flex and Bison programs are required to regenerate the ncgen parsers.
       This is not required to build the library and is only necessary if you
       change the input files.
   
   2)  The Win flex-bison project, a port of Flex & Bison tools
       to the Windows platform, is recommended. Download from:
           http://sourceforge.net/projects/winflexbison

   3)  CMake version 2.8.11.1 or higher is needed to use Win flex-bison.
       Using an earlier version of CMake will require renaming the executables
       without the "win_" prefix.
