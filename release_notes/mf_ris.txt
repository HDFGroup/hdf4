Introduction
============
The new Generic Raster (GR) interface provides a set of functions for
manipulating raster images of all kinds.  This new interface is meant to
replace the older RIS8 and RIS24 interfaces, although these older
interfaces will continue to be supported.

Generic raster images are composed of "pixels" which can have multiple
components, including but not limited to 8-bit unsigned integers.  Each image
can have multiple palettes associated with it and other 'attributes' in the
same "name=value" style as the SD*() routines have.


The new GR interface was motivated by a number of needs:

o  The need for multi-file, multi-object access to raster images, allowing
users to keep open more than one file at a time, and to "attach" more than
one raster image at a time.

o  A need to further integrate the netCDF data-model with the HDF data-models.

o  A need for a more general framework for attributes within the RIS
data-model (allowing 'name = value' style metadata).

o  A need to be able to access subsamples and subsets of images.


IMPORTANT:  The added functionality represented by this new interface has
necessitated a change in how raster images are physically represented on
disk.   As a result programs using the old single-file RIS interfaces will
only be able to read the data out of files produced by the new interface.
The metadata / attributes will not be accessible.

The following chart represents what can be done with the various interfaces
available in HDF 4.0b1:

              old RIS-API    new GR-API

old RIS         CRW             CRW
HDF files

new RIS          r              CRW
HDF files

'R' means read, 'W' means write and 'C' means create.  Entries with dashes
'-' represent functionality which has not yet been implemented.  'r' stands
for the ability to only read the data, not the metadata.


Work not yet completed, bugs, limitations
===========================================

Misc. stuff left to do:
    Deal with special elements for images.
    GRrename for images.
    GRsetflags to suppress writing fill data and to suppress fillvalue attr.
    Read/Write Interlaced data (of line & plane types, pixel is working).

Features not supported:
    Full support for multiple palettes with each RI.
    Support for named palettes with each RI.
    Support for palettes with non-standard formats.
    Deletion of attributes or images (would require changing the way index
        numbers are handled)

Other limitations:
   Currently the following design limitations are still in place:
   1 - Cannot have pixels or palette entries which contain mixed variable
        types, i.e. all the pixel/palette components must be of the same
        number type.
   2 - Currently all the components must be of valid HDF number types,
        fractional bytes (i.e. 6-bit components) or 'plain' multiple byte values
        are not handled, although they can be packed into the next larger
        sized number type in order to hold them.



How to access files and images in the new interface
======================================================


Here are the steps involved in accessing images in the new interface:

1. Open or create the file using Hopen.  This provides you with a file ID to
be used in step 2.

2. Activate the GR interface for the file with the file ID obtained from
step 1, using GRstart.  This provides you with a GR interface ID (GR ID).

3. Optionally obtain information about the raster images in the file and
global GR attributes using GRfileinfo.  Use the GR ID from step 2 to refer
to the image file.

4. Optionally find the index of a raster image, by name using
GRnametoindex, or by reference number using GRreftoindex.

5. Select for access an image with a given index, using GRselect for each
image.  Each call to GRselect returns a raster image ID (RI ID) for
subsequent accesses involving the corresponding image.

5. Access the image by its RI ID, using routines such as GRgetiminfo (to
get information about the image) and GRreadimage (to read all or part of an
image).

6. Terminate access to a given image using GRendaccess.

7. Terminate access to the GR interface for the file, using GRend.

8. Close the file using Hclose.

Notice that in the GR interface, images are identified in several ways.
Before an image is accessible ("attached"), it is identified by index,
name, and reference number. The index describes the relative position of
the image in the file. The name is a character string associated with the
image, and the reference number is a unique integer.  An image's name is
assigned by the program when it is created, and the reference number is
assigned by the HDF library when it is created. After an image is attached
, it is identified by an raster image identifier, or RI ID.

The following code fragment illustrates the steps involved in accessing the
image in a file and printing information about them.


    /* Open the file and initialize the GR interface */
    hdf_file_id=Hopen(TESTFILE,DFACC_RDWR,0);
    grid=GRstart(hdf_file_id);

    /* Obtain information about the images in the file */
    GRfileinfo(grid,&n_datasets,&n_attrs);

    /* Attach to each image and print information about it */
    for(i=0; i<n_datasets; i++)
      {
          riid=GRselect(grid,i);
          GRgetiminfo(riid,NULL,&ncomp,&nt,&il,dimsizes,&n_attrs);

          printf("%d: riid=%ld: ncomp=%ld, nt=%ld, il=%ld,
                    dim[0]=%ld, dim[1]=%ld, n_attrs=%ld\n",
                    i, riid, ncomp, nt, il, dimsizes[0],
                    dimsizes[1], n_attrs);

          /* Detach from the image */
          GRendaccess(riid);
      } /* end for */

    /* Shut down the GR interface and close the file */
    GRend(grid);
    Hclose(hdf_file_id);



"Name = value" attributes in the new interface
===============================================

Attributes of the form "name = value" were introduced in HDF 3.3, but at
that time they were available only for SDSs and files.  In HDF 4.0 we have
added the ability to attach local and global attributes to raster images
and raster image dimensions.

An attribute's "name" is a string, and "value" is the associated value or
values.  If an attribute contains more than one value, all values must be
of the same type.  For example the attribute 'valid_range' attribute might
be assigned values the maximum and minimum valid values for a given image.

Raster attributes can be "local" or "global."  A local raster image
attribute is one that applies to one raster image only. Global raster image
attributes apply to all of the images in a file.

Attributes for raster images are created by the routine GRsetattr.
Existing attributes are selected by giving an object pointer and an
attribute index.  The functions GRattrinfo, GRfindattr, and GRgetattr may
be used in combination to read attributes and their values.  GRattrinfo
gets the name , number type, and number of values for an attribute with a
given index.  GRfindattr gets the index of an attribute with a given name,
and GRreadattr reads the values associate with an attribute with a given
index.

The following example illustrates how to attach GR image attributes, and
also GR global (file) attributes.

    /* Open file and initialize the GR interface */
    hdf_file_id=Hopen(TESTFILE,DFACC_RDWR,0);
    grid=GRstart(hdf_file_id);

    /* Create a global attribute  -- applies to all rasters in the file */
    HDstrcpy(attr_name,"Test1");
    HDstrcpy(u8_attr,"Attribute value 1");
    GRsetattr(grid,attr_name,DFNT_UINT8,HDstrlen(u8_attr)+1,u8_attr);

    GRfileinfo(grid,&n_datasets,&n_attrs);

    /* select every image in the file, and
       assign a local attribute to each */
    for(i=0; i<n_datasets; i++)
      {
          /* Attach to image with index==i */
          riid=GRselect(grid,i);

          /* Create an attribute for the image */
          HDstrcpy(attr_name,"Image1");
          HDstrcpy(u8_attr,"Attribute value 1");
          GRsetattr(riid,attr_name,DFNT_UINT8,HDstrlen(u8_attr)+1,u8_attr);

          GRgetiminfo(riid,NULL,&ncomp,&nt,&il,dimsizes,&n_attrs);

          printf("%d: riid=%ld: ncomp=%ld, nt=%ld, il=%ld, dim[0]=%ld,
                  dim[1]=%ld, n_attrs=%ld\n",i,riid,ncomp,nt,il,
                  dimsizes[0], dimsizes[1],n_attrs);

                for(j=0; j<n_attrs; j++)
                  {
                    GRattrinfo(riid,j,attr_name,&nt,&ncomp);

                    GRgetattr(riid,j,u8_attr);
                    printf("Image #%d Attribute #%d: Name=%s, Value=%s\n",
                             i,j,attr_name,u8_attr);
                  } /* end for */

          /* Detach from the image */
          GRendaccess(riid);
      } /* end for */

    /* Shut down the GR interface */
    GRend(grid);

    /* Close the file */
    Hclose(hdf_file_id);



Dealing with annotations in the new interface
================================================

The new GR interface allows you to reference rasters explicitly, by "GR
id".  A GR id is different from its reference number.  Since annotation
routines attach annotations to objects by reference number, there needs to
be a mechanism for determining the reference number of a raster image,
given its id. This is made possible by the addition of the routine
GRidtoref.

A similar problem occurs when going the other way.  For example, a call to
DFANlabellist returns the reference numbers of objects that are
annotated.  If those objects are RISs (i.e. they have the tag DFTAG_RIG),
we need to map the reference numbers to the corresponding images.  For
this, a two-step process is required.  You can use the function
GRreftoindex to get the index, or position, of the dataset that has a
certain reference number, then you use the routine GRselect to get the id
for the image in that position.

Routine Descriptions
====================

Most of the routines in the GR interface return a status value of type intn
(native integers).  If the status is equal to SUCCEED the routine completed
successfully.  If it is equal to FAIL an error occurred, information about
the error may be available by calling HEprint(filestream, 0).  SUCCEED and
FAIL are defined in hdf.h for C users and in constant.i for Fortran
programs.

All IDs (hdf_file_id, grid, riid) are int32 quantities.

Prototypes for these functions can be found in the file hproto.h

Routines that can be called from C are all of the form GRxxx

        char *filename;     IN: name of the external file
        int32 offset;       IN: offset in the external file to store the image

 RETURNS
    SUCCEED/FAIL

 DESCRIPTION
    Makes the image data of an RI into an external element special element.
        Cause the actual data for a dataset to be stored in an
        external file.  This can only be done once for any given
        dataset and it is the user's responsibility to make sure the
        external datafile is transported when the "header" file is
        moved.  The offset is the number of byte from the beginning of
        the file where the data should be stored.  This routine can
        only be called on HDF 3.3 files (i.e. calling on an XDR-based
        netCDF file that was opened with the multi-file interface will
        fail).
